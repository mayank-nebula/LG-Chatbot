Here's an enhanced and clearer explanation of each of the relevant points for your backend functionality:

1. Encrypted Conversations in MongoDB:
Encryption of Conversations: All user conversations stored in MongoDB will be fully encrypted using a user-specific encryption key. This ensures that even if the database is compromised, the conversations remain inaccessible without the key.
Key-Based Decryption: When the user logs into the application, they will need to provide their unique encryption key to decrypt and access their conversations. This adds a strong layer of protection, making it impossible for others to view the data without the user's permission.
Key Recovery with Security Question: In case the user forgets their encryption key, they can recover it by answering a pre-set security question. The key itself will be stored in MongoDB in an encrypted format, ensuring that even the recovery process is secure.
No Traceable Logging: Since no logs will be kept, there will be no traces of decryption keys, conversations, or any sensitive user data in the logs.
2. User-Specific ChromaDB Collections for Embeddings:
Separate Collections: Each user will have their own separate ChromaDB collection to store embeddings. This means the data generated for one user is completely isolated from that of another user, enhancing data privacy.
Improved Security and Privacy: By keeping the embeddings in distinct collections, the application guarantees that even if one collection is compromised, only the specific user's data is at risk, and not the entire user base.
Access Control: The application ensures that only the user who owns the embeddings can access or manage them.
3. Encrypted Email Storage:
Email Encryption: All emails uploaded by the user will be stored in MongoDB in an encrypted format. This guarantees that email content cannot be accessed by anyone, including administrators, without the user's unique decryption key.
User-Controlled Decryption: Each user will use their encryption key to decrypt and access their uploaded emails. Without the key, the email content remains secure and unreadable.
Strong Encryption: The encryption mechanism will use industry-standard algorithms like AES-256, providing robust security against any form of unauthorized access.
4. JWT Tokens for Authentication and Authorization:
Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) will be used to authenticate users securely. When the user logs in, they will receive a signed JWT token that serves as proof of identity.
Authorization: JWT tokens will also manage authorization by defining the user’s role and permissions. This will ensure that users can only access or perform actions on data that they are authorized to view or modify.
Stateless Security: JWTs are stateless, meaning the application doesn’t need to maintain sessions in the backend, reducing the risk of session hijacking and enhancing scalability.
5. Azure Key Vault for Secret Management:
Secret Management: Azure Key Vault will be used to store and manage sensitive information such as encryption keys, JWT signing keys, and API credentials.
Secret Rotation: Azure Key Vault allows automatic rotation of secrets. This enhances security by ensuring that secrets like encryption keys or API credentials are regularly updated without requiring manual intervention.
Secure Access: Only authorized services and users will have access to the secrets in Azure Key Vault, providing an extra layer of protection against unauthorized access to sensitive data.
By following these security practices, your backend will be highly secure, with encryption mechanisms ensuring data privacy and protection against unauthorized access. The system will also enable user-friendly features like key recovery while maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of user data.

Here’s an enhanced version of your point, reflecting that emails will be stored in Azure Blob Storage:

3. Encrypted Email Storage in Azure Blob Storage:
Email Encryption: All emails uploaded by the user will be encrypted before being stored in Azure Blob Storage. This ensures that even if the storage is compromised, the email contents remain secure and unreadable without the encryption key.
Azure Blob Security Features: Azure Blob Storage provides additional security features like encryption at rest and in transit, access control policies, and integration with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for user authentication.
User-Controlled Decryption: Each user will use their unique encryption key to decrypt and access their emails. The key is required to retrieve and read email contents, providing an additional layer of security.
Efficient Storage: Using Azure Blob Storage ensures that emails are efficiently stored and accessible while maintaining security standards, offering scalable storage solutions.
Data Privacy: Emails are securely isolated per user, ensuring that only the user can access their uploaded emails, with strict access controls in place via Azure.
