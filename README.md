Hey Maria, the issue is still happening. One possibility I’m looking into is that CHATBOT_BACKEND_URL might need to be available as a runtime environment variable, but in our current Dockerfile it looks like it's only being passed during the build stage. If that’s the case, the value may not be present in the final running container when the API route tries to read process.env.CHATBOT_BACKEND_URL. I’m not fully certain yet, but I can try updating the Dockerfile and submit another PR, just let me know whether you’d prefer me to handle it or if your team would like to look at the Docker configuration.
