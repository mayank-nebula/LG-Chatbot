To provide reliable, cost-effective transportation services through her own logistics brand; and, to champion the power of diversity in supply chain.</p>\n<p>Born in Somalia, Amani moved to the US and achieved a degree in supply logistics, management and leadership from Portland State University before going on to establish a successful corporate career. Having gained extensive experience across supplier management, business process and operations, Amani went on to found her own business, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/malao-logistics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-schema-attribute=\"\">Malao Logistics</a>, Minnesota’s premier logistics company specializing in freight brokerage and transportation services.</p>\n<p>Today Amani will be talking to us about her career so far; moving out of the corporate world to found her own business; taking a family approach to logistics; and the importance of diversity in industry. Plus, she’ll be sharing her experiences as a woman in supply chain, as well as her words of advice for all of the women following in her footsteps.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>SHOW SPONSOR: </strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This Women In Supply Chain™ feature was made possible by our sponsor, <a href=\"https://emergemarket.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-schema-attribute=\"\">Emerge</a>. As a company focused on empowering and growing meaningful supply chain relationships, Emerge is proud to sponsor Women In Supply Chain™.

With logistics, because there’s always transport.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[13.25] Amani’s experience at global outdoor brand Columbia Sportswear Company, and how the woman-led business inspired her.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Coming from a male-dominated company, all the leadership… everybody was a woman!&#8230; It really showed me what it is to be a woman in supply chain, and how to take it to the next level.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[15.47] Amani’s previous role at Boeing, the importance of supplier diversity and how businesses should approach it.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Think of it like a mentorship program… the more you mentor us, the more we get bigger and the more we can support you – you can literally customize us the way you want to!”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[20.35] The differences between corporate and small business, and why Amani made the decision to start her own company, Malao Logistics.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“In corporate, things move so slow… and the supply chain doesn’t wait!”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[23.09] A closer look at Malao, what they do, and how they help their customers.</p>\n<p>[25.21] Some of the challenges Amani has faced whilst establishing Malao Logistics.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“The hardest part is being accepted in the community… I know the journey is hard, but I have to do this for all the women… I want to be the woman they look up to and say ‘well she did it, why can’t I?’”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[27.22] Amani’s experiences at large industry events, particularly as a woman who wears a head scarf.</p>\n<p>[32.56] How Amani found, and embraced, her voice, and her advice for others.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Don’t give up on your dreams, because if you give up on yourself, don’t expect anyone else to believe in you.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[36.47] The future for Amani, and for Malao Logistics.</p>\n<p>[38.42] Amani’s final words of wisdom for the women following in her footsteps.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>RESOURCES AND LINKS MENTIONED:</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can connect with Amani over on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/amani-radman-74253684/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-schema-attribute=\"\">LinkedIn</a>.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to hear more from Amani, check out <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/episode265/\">Episode 20 of Blended – DEI in the Workplace – Not Just The Smart Thing To Do, But The Right Thing To Do</a>.

Pando is the TMS of choice for Fortune 500 manufacturers, retailers, and logistics companies globally, with a presence across Southeast Asia, the Middle East and North America. Pando’s network‑powered SaaS platform for supply chain execution helps enterprises digitalize, automate, and scale their logistics operations across all modes and legs of movement.</p>\n<p>Today Nitin Jayakrishnan, co-founder and CEO at Pando, joins me to chat all about the company: what they do; the key challenges in global logistics; the power of collaborative optimization; and why businesses need to look beyond cost saving, towards improved accuracy, responsiveness and predictability</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<h2><strong>IN THIS EPISODE WE DISCUSS:</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>[06.57] Nitin’s founder story, and the journey that led him to establish Pando.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“We set out to build a marketplace for domestic freight – Uber for freight!&#8230; Along the way something interesting started happening: our customers&#8230; started asking us if we could expand our tech into other freight and warehousing providers.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[11.20] An overview of Pando – what they do, and how they help their customers.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Most management solutions were built before the year 2000… The tech that sustains global supply chains is completely archaic!”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[15.57] A look at some of the key challenges Pando’s customers are facing right now, and Pando’s approach to solving them.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;These are brands that we love and live with… these brands ultimately serve you and me, so the mission for Pando, of course is to solve supply chain issues and logistics inefficiencies, but really is to serve the brand we love to help those brands serve us better!”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[23.21] The importance of good data, and Pando’s game-changing control tower capabilities.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;You don’t put the control tower at the top, you put it at the bottom – it’s the foundational layer of data that feeds into these systems… the input is controlled, so you’re not only able to solve the data problem, but you’re able to predict and prevent the challenges.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>[27.00] A closer look at Pando’s TMS solution, and how it can revolutionize dispatch planning and decision-making.</p>\n<p>[30.25] Integration, and how Pando work with their network of partners.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Companies are now realizing that what was once called back end operations is now coming front and center of their global strategies.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[36.22] Sustainability, how Pando facilitates a reduction in carbon footprint for their customers, and why clients increasingly expect their suppliers to be an active part of helping them achieve their own ESG goals.</p>\n<p>[40.25] The onboarding process with Pando, and their mission to deliver fast and effective integration.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“With Pando, the time to value is 90 days – and that’s a gamechanger. It’s a gold standard when it comes to enterprise technology.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[43.43] The ideal client for Pando.</p>\n<p>[45.21] Two key case studies, illustrating how Pando helped one customer reduce supply chain costs and achieve end-to-end visibility, and another solve shipping efficiency issues in order to realize an additional $2.5 million in revenue.</p>\n<p>[48.39] The future for Pando.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>RESOURCES AND LINKS MENTIONED:</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Head over to Pando’s <a href=\"https://www.pando.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-schema-attribute=\"\">website</a> now to find out more and discover how they could help you too.

I’m joined by another incredible panel of guests and we’re talking about diverse talent in the workplace, and how to keep it. From labor shortages to issues around retention, I’m having more and more conversations about talent on Let’s Talk Supply Chain, and it really was time to bring that conversation over to Blended. Ensuring you have diverse talent in your business could be the difference between surviving and thriving, so it’s something everyone should be taking seriously.</p>\n<p>Today, our guests will be discussing the current landscape in supply chain when it comes to talent; sharing their own personal experiences; tackling how to successfully hire and retain talent; and discussing exactly how we navigate bias to improve company culture.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>IN THIS EPISODE WE DISCUSS:</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>[00.45] Introductions to our Blended panelists.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bryant – Digital Content Marketing Manager, Corporate Communications at Blue Yonder</li>\n<li>Meredith – Senior HR Director at DHL Supply Chain</li>\n<li>Heidi – Founder of Diversity Study Group</li>\n<li>Sugathri – Program Director, Women In Supply Chain™s at Digital Supply Chain Institute</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“The landscape is transforming like never before.” Sugathri</p></blockquote>\n<p>[03.50] The group dives into the current landscape in supply chain when it comes to talent, and reflects on the truth behind the headlines around ‘talent shortages’ and the ‘great resignation.’</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is there a difference between talent and labor shortages?</li>\n<li>Working with the right recruiter</li>\n<li>Changing the face of the wider industry you work within</li>\n<li>Selling your brand</li>\n<li>Understanding the changing market and needs of the next generation</li>\n<li>Robust retention plans</li>\n<li>Culture work</li>\n<li>How does leadership need to change?</li>\n<li>Making DEI a business case</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“Ensuring that you have the right wages and the right benefits have become really important – if you’re not hitting the mark on that, and if your culture is not right, people aren’t going to come and work for you. Or they’ll come, and then they’ll leave.” Meredith</p></blockquote>\n<p>[21.56] The panel reflects on the step before retention – hiring the right talent.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are talent shortages a result of dated and exclusionary hiring practices?</li>\n<li>Driving diversity of thought, which leads to innovation</li>\n<li>Crafting diverse teams</li>\n<li>How do we ensure diverse voices are heard equally?</li>\n<li>Allyship and elevating others&#8217; voices</li>\n<li>Why it’s not just an HR issue</li>\n<li>Unconscious bias</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“It’s a candidate driven, employee market, and its absolutely essential that organisations are pitching themselves right.” Heidi</p></blockquote>\n<p>[40.47] The group shares their personal experiences and dive deeper into unconscious bias: what it means, the impact on retaining talent and how we successfully navigate through it in the workplace to help retention.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Giving regular feedback</li>\n<li>Creating boards and panels instead of making things one person’s responsibility</li>\n<li>Communication and conversation</li>\n<li>Sharing of personal experience and perspective</li>\n<li>Taking accountability for our own bias</li>\n<li>How we can help others to make it personal, connect and understand</li>\n<li>Creating working communities</li>\n<li>Address it head-on</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“Anybody who has been ‘othered’ is always asking themselves those questions – do I have an unconscious bias? And it’s terrifying when you have to come face to face with yourself and admit it.” Bryant</p></blockquote>\n<p>[1.13.14] The panel summarizes their thoughts on how organizations can successfully retain talent.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Flexibility</li>\n<li>Being proactive instead of reactive</li>\n<li>Ensure people feel accepted, included and valued</li>\n<li>Visible leadership</li>\n<li>Intention</li>\n<li>Building the right culture</li>\n<li>Overhaul your hiring processes to better onboard diverse employees</li>\n<li>Support the creation of communities within your organization</li>\n<li>Train managers to lead diverse teams</li>\n<li>Make it all transparent</li>\n<li>Create mentorship and sponsorship opportunities</li>\n<li>Develop a formal retention plan</li>\n<li>Stand in solidarity with diverse employees</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[01.27.23] The group sums up their thoughts from today’s discussion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>RESOURCES AND LINKS MENTIONED:</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can connect with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryantjmiller/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-schema-attribute=\"\">Bryant</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/halcyonrecruitment/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-schema-attribute=\"\">Heidi</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/meredith-singletary-b824512/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-schema-attribute=\"\">Meredith</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sugathrikolluru/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-schema-attribute=\"\">Sugathri</a> over on LinkedIn.</p>\n<p>If you found this episode interesting, you might enjoy <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/episode265/\">Episode 20, DEI in the Workplace – Not Just The Smart Thing To Do, But The Right Thing To Do </a>or <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/episode252/\">Episode 18, Hiding in Plain Sight: The Reality of Workplace Discrimination</a>.</p>\n<p>Check out our other podcasts <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/podcast\">HERE</a>.</p>\n",

We’ll be discussing the ins and outs of complex project management; explaining how you can level up information to leadership, so you can make the best decisions for your operations; and exactly how Quickbase can help.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>IN THIS EPISODE WE DISCUSS:</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>[01.54] The landscape of project management in a post-COVID environment: how companies are working, and how a focus on this area can help businesses to thrive in this period of recovery.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“You’re seeing a lot of new technology in the project management space… but a lot of the themes are still the same. You’re still going to find people working in silos, with whatever tool they’re working in – and, a lot of the times, in tools that aren’t customized for their workflows.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[03.58] The increasing complexity in project management, and some of the main challenges involved in trying to keep quickly moving parts on track.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“A lot of the challenges with project management is bringing all of those pieces together, and making sure that all your business partners can collaborate around that same information.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[05.52] Supplier diversity – why you need to make it a project in itself, and how to manage complexity and adjust processes to set yourself up for success.</p>\n<p>[11.13] Why visibility means different things to different people, and how businesses can make that visibility meaningful and actionable.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Visibility always starts with a conversation of ‘who are my stakeholders?’ and that visibility will be different depending on where in the business you’re having that conversation.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[13.33] A closer look at Quickbase’s Project Management Software, what it does and how it helps to address key industry challenges.</p>\n<p>[16.40] The importance of customizable solutions in helping to level up a business’s project management success.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“When you don’t customize, it means you’re now conforming to a process that was defined for you, with some assumptions&#8230; Any time you make somebody change how they work to match how your tool works, you’re adding an inefficiency.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[22.04] Leadership priorities, and how visibility and integration within project management can help them make better strategic decisions.</p>\n<p>[25.08] The challenges of labor allocation during project planning, and how Quickbases’s solution can help businesses to address the wider staffing challenges happening in the industry.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I can’t tell you the amount of people I’ve spoken with that actually quit jobs because their leadership didn’t invest in modern technology – especially with younger generations coming out of school, it’s just an expectation.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[28.35] The growing importance of material management.</p>\n<p>[30.52] A look at how Quickbase works with construction brands to help build trusted connections and systems to bring all stakeholders successfully together.</p>\n<p>[34.39] What the future holds for project management, and for Quickbase.</p>\n<p>[36.25] Peter’s key takeaways from today’s discussion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>RESOURCES AND LINKS MENTIONED:</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Head over to Quickbase’s <a href=\"https://www.quickbase.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-schema-attribute=\"\">website</a> now to find out more and discover how they could help you too.

Previously on the show, we’ve talked to underrepresented groups and specific communities – whether it be women, people of color, trans folks – and, as part of our discussions, we’ve heard them passionately share their stories and illustrate why, of course, they’re such an integral part of successful teams. So we thought it was time to really put a focus on that and dedicate a whole show to the importance of embracing DEI in your business.</p>\n<p>Today, our guests will be exploring what DEI means to them; sharing their own personal experiences; reflecting on issues such as creating safe spaces, ongoing education and authenticity; and discussing the importance of supplier diversity.</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2><strong>IN THIS EPISODE WE DISCUSS:</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>[00.49] Introductions to our Blended panelists.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“DEI encompasses the relationship, philosophy and culture of acknowledging, embracing, supporting and accepting those of all racial, sexual, gender, religious and socio-economic backgrounds (among other differentiators).” Gennifer</p></blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Shay – Senior Event Manager at S&amp;P Global</li>\n<li>Asheley – Director of Customer Success at Flowspace</li>\n<li>Gennifer – Founder/Executive Director at TransNewYork</li>\n<li>Amani – Director Of Operations at Malao Logistics</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[06.41] The group discusses DEI: what it means; why it’s important; the challenges; and real-life examples of who’s doing it right and who’s doing it wrong.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Companies that adapt their strategies and their policies around the different groups of people they have working in their organization and don’t treat it just like a blanket initiative, and really get down into the details of who their people are and what challenges they face&#8230; that’s when you can really look at whether your environment is inclusive or not.” Shay</p></blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Creating the right environment and culture</li>\n<li>Accepting people for who they are</li>\n<li>Representation</li>\n<li>Burden of tokenism</li>\n<li>Impact of Gen Z</li>\n<li>Education and training</li>\n<li>Budgets and investment</li>\n<li>Advocacy and mentorship</li>\n<li>Creating safe spaces</li>\n<li>Celebrating awareness days and months, and finding the right balance</li>\n<li>Intention and authenticity</li>\n<li>Consistency</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“It’s not about just the [awareness] month – because I’m going to be black every single day, not just in February!” Asheley</p></blockquote>\n<p>[01.10.21] The panel takes a closer look at both the obstacles and benefits of supplier diversity.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increasing customer demand for diversity</li>\n<li>Barriers for small businesses, eg extended payment terms, expensive tables at events etc</li>\n<li>Making it equitable</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[01.20.19] The group sum-up their learnings from today’s discussion.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“It’s a way of living, it’s a collective thing. If I want people to know my culture, I also need to show my culture… if I know my team isn’t super aware, it’s also my job to educate.” Amani</p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>RESOURCES AND LINKS MENTIONED:</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can connect with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/shay-abrahams/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-schema-attribute=\"\">Shay</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/asheley/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-schema-attribute=\"\">Asheley</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-gennifer-herley-phd-8aa954b6/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-schema-attribute=\"\">Gennifer</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/amani-radman-74253684/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-schema-attribute=\"\">Amani</a> over on LinkedIn.</p>\n<p>If you found this episode interesting, you might enjoy <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/147-blended-episode-1-whats-in-a-word/\">Episode 1,What’s In A Word</a> or <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/episode194/\">Episode 7, Equality vs Diversity: What’s The Difference?</a>.</p>\n<p>Check out our other podcasts <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/podcast\">HERE</a>.</p>\n",

It’s time companies become fully connected to the people who make and move our products, and look for ways to improve the way we plan, buy, and move them around the world.

As a leader at Emerge, she’s helping to save shippers time and money by operationalizing game-changing products.</p>\n<p>Today Maggie will be talking to us about her career so far; her talent for operations strategy; the excitement of start-up culture; and Mom guilt. Plus, she’ll be sharing her experiences as a woman in the industry, as well as her words of advice for all of the women following in her footsteps.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><strong>SHOW SPONSOR:</strong></h1>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This Women In Supply Chain™ feature was made possible by our sponsor, <a href=\"https://emergemarket.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-schema-attribute=\"\">Emerge</a>.

I thought: ‘my baby is so small, how can I leave her all day’? and that was so hard.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[26.39] Why Maggie loves the culture and benefits that come from working in a start-up, and her experiences, as a woman, of working in those environments.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Start-ups can be extremely lucrative and awesome opportunities for everyone. At a start-up, you have better access to having a seat at the table, having your voice heard and ideas implemented.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[29.30] How saying yes and trying something new in business helped Maggie to find her voice and grow in confidence.</p>\n<p>[31.35] Maggie’s work ethic, the difference between advocates and mentors and why it’s important to have both.</p>\n<p>[34.16] What the future holds for Maggie, and for Emerge.</p>\n<p>[34.53] Maggie’s words of advice for all of the women following in her footsteps.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><strong>RESOURCES AND LINKS MENTIONED:</strong></h1>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can connect with Maggie over on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/maggie-petrovic-81500926/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-schema-attribute=\"\">LinkedIn</a>.</p>\n<p>If you enjoyed finding out more about female leaders at Emerge, why not check out <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/episode255/\">episode 255</a>, where I&#8217;m joined by Mardi Tegmeyer, Customer Success Manager at Emerge.

It’s a sensitive subject: something that a lot of people have actually experienced, but not something we like to talk much about. So, of course, it’s a topic we want to tackle head-on!</p>\n<p>Today, our guests will be discussing exactly what discrimination means and why it happens; sharing their own personal experiences; reflecting on the differences between discrimination, micro-aggressions, victimization and bullying; and the panel will be sharing their advice for creating more supportive and inclusive workplaces.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>IN THIS EPISODE WE DISCUSS:</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>[0.33] Introductions to our Blended panelists.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dyci – Founder and CEO of New Gen Architects</li>\n<li>Jennifer – Director of Public Information at Citizen Potawatomi Nation</li>\n<li>Miles – Co-founder &amp; CEO of Cargologik</li>\n<li>Brittany – Marketing Director at Interior Design Magazine</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[02.40] The group discusses the basics around workplace discrimination: what it means, the reasons that people are discriminated against and how it differs from bullying, harassment, victimization and microaggressions.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I always look at workplace discrimination as a clear barrier or blockage to a job, an opportunity, or a role, because of, not necessarily the way that someone identifies, but how that person is perceived.” Dyci</p></blockquote>\n<p>[10.28] The panel shares their own personal experiences of workplace discrimination, and the impact of those experiences.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dyci’s experience of micro-aggressions</li>\n<li>Disguising bias behind a compliment</li>\n<li>How discrimination changes across industries</li>\n<li>Miles’s experience of victimization</li>\n<li>HR in theory vs HR in practice</li>\n<li>Discrimination in fundraising</li>\n<li>Conscious vs unconscious bias</li>\n<li>Tolerance</li>\n<li>Jennifer’s experience of being silenced</li>\n<li>White passing, ownership of culture ad exclusion</li>\n<li>Brittany’s experience of seeing an interview candidate excluded due to disability</li>\n<li>Woman to woman discrimination and competition</li>\n<li>Representation and internalized diversity quotas</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“HR is usually treated as an extension of legal… so resolution never seemed like the authentic goal. But now it seems like it is… with a newer movement towards becoming more aware, you can institute an objective third party, mentorship, a safe space, where it&#8217;s more a function of culture than legal.” Miles</p></blockquote>\n<p>[52.23] The group shares their suggestions for actionable ideas and insights for our own workplaces.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Education and ongoing learning</li>\n<li>Creating safe spaces</li>\n<li>Mentorship</li>\n<li>Blind applications</li>\n<li>Developing a reporting process that doesn’t involve naming your accuser</li>\n<li>Speaking up and supporting others</li>\n<li>Asking for help, bringing in external expertise</li>\n<li>Building the right culture</li>\n<li>Re-branding HR</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“It’s about engaging people in a way that doesn’t feel like just checking a box, it’s about engaging people on every single level, from entry level to C Suite.” Brittany</p></blockquote>\n<p>[1.17.56] The panelists sum up their learnings from today’s discussion.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“It’s also incumbent on each of us to not allow space for discrimination, to call it out whenever we see it, to say ‘there’s no room for that attitude here.’” Jennifer</p></blockquote>\n<h2><strong>RESOURCES AND LINKS MENTIONED:</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can connect with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dycimanns/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-schema-attribute=\"\">Dyci</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifermbell/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-schema-attribute=\"\">Jennifer</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mvarghese/#hello\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-schema-attribute=\"\">Miles</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/brittany-lloyd-00b2a061/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-schema-attribute=\"\">Brittany</a> over on LinkedIn.</p>\n<p>Check out our other podcasts <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/podcast\">HERE</a>.</p>\n",

As a third-party logistics company, it provides access to thousands of transportation providers and has the capacity to resolve all of your shipping needs. Backed by game-changing technology and its culture for reliable service and relentless passion, R2 Logistics has built a strong reputation as an industry leader.</p>\n<p>Today Frank Dreischarf, Vice President of Supply Chain Solutions at R2 Logistics, joins me to chat all about the company: what they do; overcoming challenges in the midst of disruption; and the importance of collaboration and visibility in supply chain.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>IN THIS EPISODE WE DISCUSS:</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>[08.28] R2 Logistics’ background and how they’ve evolved into the company they are today.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“That expedite mentality, that sense of urgency, is part of our organizational DNA.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[11.29] A closer look at the R2 Logistics transportation management system, its features and the benefits.</p>\n<p>[14.10] From expedited to intermodal, a look at R2 Logistics&#8217; full suite of services for shippers.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I like to say that we’re in the ‘headache elimination’ business. Our job is to work with our strategic customers, figure out what their needs are, anticipate those needs (sometimes before they even know that they have them) and come up with solutions.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[15.08] The importance of transparency and why R2 Logistics partner with industry-leading tech providers to offer the highest level of visibility.</p>\n<p>[17.12] The R2 Logistics carrier offering.</p>\n<p>[19.13] A closer look at the platform itself, and its user-friendly interface.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Everything, from the interface to how the customer interacts with the system, is designed to make it as easy as possible.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[21.23] The speed and ease of an R2 Logistics implementation, and the on-boarding audits that help new customers ensure they have the best prices and achieve the most value from the process.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“We&#8217;re able to add a lot of value to customers that are in that mid-small size range… because companies of that size just don’t have the economic resources to hire the professionals necessary to adequately manage that transportation spend.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[26.50] The R2 Way, and why this unique set of principles sets them apart.</p>\n<p>[30.05] From the importance of surety of supply to a new appreciation for collaboration, Frank’s reflections on the state of the industry right now, and the key trends and learnings coming out of it.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“People are starting to realize that relationships matter, collaboration matters. Those customers or shippers out there that have forever viewed their relationships with their transportation providers as tactical, rather than strategic, are suffering right now.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[34.30] The ideal customer for R2 Logistics.</p>\n<p>[36.22] A case study detailing how R2 Logistics was able to help a key customer quickly integrate new acquisitions into their network and reduce transportation costs by 15%.</p>\n<p>[38.27] The future for R2 Logistics.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>RESOURCES AND LINKS MENTIONED:</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Head over to R2 Logistics’ <a href=\"https://www.r2logistics.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-schema-attribute=\"\">website</a> now to find out more and discover how they could help you too.

When it comes to the spectrum of topics in the DEI world, it’s not the most talked about, so it’s important to open it up, hear what others have to say and learn something new. And that’s exactly why we do the show: diving into other people’s experiences, leaning into empathy, engaging with new points of view – it’s what opens up our minds and makes us all better employees, leaders, entrepreneurs, and people.</p>\n<p>Today we’ll be diving into our guests personal experiences with ageism; why ageism isn’t just an issue for the old; ageism’s place within the larger context of DEI discussions; and the panel will be sharing their advice for creating more inclusive workplaces.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>IN THIS EPISODE WE DISCUSS:</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>[0.32] Introductions to our Blended panellists.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lisa – Supply Chain Manager at Rapala VMC Corporation</li>\n<li>Lavinia – Founder and Host of Women in Blockchain Talks</li>\n<li>Brendan – Founder and CEO at AccidentPlan</li>\n<li>Leona – Chief Technology Officer at Benefits Data Trust</li>\n<li>Rebecca – Assistant Director, Vessel Services Division at T&amp;T Salvage LLC</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“At my dinner table, there’s nobody smarter than the oldest teenager and nobody dumber than a boomer!” Brendan</p></blockquote>\n<p>[06.02] The guests share their own experiences with ageism, and reflect on why it continues to be an issue within the workplace and society overall.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dynamic between generations</li>\n<li>How old you look vs how old you are</li>\n<li>Capability, experience and knowledge</li>\n<li>The truth behind assumptions</li>\n<li>The words we use, their implications and reshaping the conversation</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“I’ve had people assume that I don’t understand how to use something as simple as Facebook. I’ve built systems more complex than Facebook! …There’s an assumption that, if you’re of a certain age, you don’t understand.” Leona</p></blockquote>\n<p>[32.14] The panel discuss how we can better support people as they move through their careers, and ensure that at every stage, it’s working for everyone.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Job shadowing and mentorship</li>\n<li>Cultural belonging and creating safe spaces</li>\n<li>Allyship and finding your voice</li>\n<li>Fear of losing your job</li>\n<li>Policies and procedures</li>\n<li>Bias – challenging each other and modelling for others</li>\n<li>Leadership</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“How do you develop a culture where speaking up is acceptable? We can educate ourselves and have the right motives, but to put that out into the universe requires courage. And that’s the systemic change we need to see, this overwhelming sense of courage to speak for truth.” Rebecca</p></blockquote>\n<p>[56.42] The group dig deeper into the reasons that ageism is rife throughout society, and how we can move out of a culture of divided workplaces.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Unless you’re willing to stand up and support someone else’s action, change is very slow and you only see it many years after the damage has been done.” Lavinia</p></blockquote>\n<p>[1.06.08] The panellists consider ageism alongside other issues within the world of diversity and inclusion, and why we don’t talk about it as much as we should.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Self-reflection, introspection and challenging our own bias</li>\n<li>Learned bias</li>\n<li>Creating two-way conversations and non-toxic dialogues</li>\n<li>Courage to face push back</li>\n<li>Self-development</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[1.15.20] The panelists sum-up their learnings from today’s discussion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>RESOURCES AND LINKS MENTIONED:</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can connect with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisafentoncscmp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-schema-attribute=\"\">Lisa</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/laviniaosbourne/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-schema-attribute=\"\">Lavinia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/brendandawsonmanwithtruck/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-schema-attribute=\"\">Brendan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/leonathomas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-schema-attribute=\"\">Leona</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebecca-garcia-malone-0190772a/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-schema-attribute=\"\">Rebecca</a> over on LinkedIn.</p>\n<p>Check out our other podcasts <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/podcast\">HERE</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

And you can only define the measurements, if you know the strategy. And that was my evolution to supply chain strategy.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[17.06] Anne’s role as Chief Strategy Officer at Kinaxis, and her reflections on empowering supply chain professionals through combining people and technology.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“When you introduce human behavior, along with the best analytics possible, that combination allows you to react and respond to the world around you, to make the best decisions for your supply chain.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[22.29] How becoming a member of INFORMS as a student inspired Anne, her role as president of the organization and why being a part of an industry body during the course of your career is a must.</p>\n<p>[28.52] Anne’s role as a mentor at Creative Destruction Lab, why mentors are so important, why you should have multiple mentors throughout your career, and what makes a good mentor/mentee relationship.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“A mentor of mine, pretty early on, said: ‘It’s important for you to be a chameleon, always be relevant to the conversation.’ ”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[34.20] Anne’s experience of balancing motherhood and a successful career, and why we need to talk about it.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“A lot of people forget that you’re not in the same circumstances that you were before, so it was challenging going back to work – and we don’t talk about that enough.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[37.35] What the future holds for Anne.</p>\n<p>[38.52] Anne’s words of advice to all of the women following in her footsteps.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>RESOURCES AND LINKS MENTIONED:</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can connect with Anne over on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/anne-robinson-449225/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-schema-attribute=\"\">LinkedIn</a>.</p>\n<p>Check out our other podcasts <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/podcast/\">HERE</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Instead of putting the spotlight onto an industry brand, I’m joined by special guest Brian Glick, founder and CEO at Chain.io and good friend, to talk about a timely topic in supply chain.</p>\n<p>We talk all about what to do when times get tough in supply chain, just like they are right now! We discuss the importance of data; the power of collaboration; and why you should be putting more focus on sustainability in your business. Plus, Brian shares his insights on getting back to basics, refocusing on process and remembering that being good at execution is a core competence that can set you apart from the competition.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>IN THIS EPISODE WE DISCUSS:</h2>\n<p>[07.04] Reflections on 2021.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“We’ve all learned that there are no simple solutions to singular problems in supply chain.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[11.00] Despite disruption, why now is the right time to get back to basics with our businesses.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“You can’t sprint a marathon, and you can only sustain the bad or broken business processes for so long before you’re just going to collapse.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[15.12] How we can start to identify the quick wins within our businesses &#8211; key areas to simplify and optimize that will make a big difference.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“There are low hanging fruit. The thing I like about document automation, for example, is that you don’t have to get your extended supply chain to come along on the journey with you.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[17.21] The importance of data and making the most of data partners and tools.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“You don’t have to do it all yourself anymore.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[23.32] Sustainability in business and supply chain, and why it integrates more easily than you might think.</p>\n<p>[28.18] The power of collaboration and connectivity; plus how, and why, Brian created a collaborative ethos at his business, Chain.io.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Opening up and elevating your conversations to everyone who’s in your value network and exposing them to data… creates opportunity that you didn’t even think about.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[36.48] The future for supply chain.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“We need to settle into the fact that we don’t live in the same world we lived in five years ago.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[39.23] Final words of encouragement for how can we all not just survive, but thrive, during and after this period of disruption.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>RESOURCES AND LINKS MENTIONED:</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Head over to Chain.io’s <a href=\"https://www.chain.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-schema-attribute=\"\">website</a> now to find out more and discover how they could help you too.

In episode 12 we talked all about immigration – our guests gave us an insight into their personal journeys, and how those experiences shaped them; we talked about struggling with identity; and we reflected on what we can do, as leaders, to celebrate diversity through immigration, to create opportunities and to elevate those voices.</p>\n<p>Now it’s episode 13, we’re stepping into year two of Blended, I’m so excited to bring you all more – and today we’re talking about disability. The subject of disability has come up in other shows, particularly when we’ve talked about rights or discrimination. But sometimes we are all guilty of talking broadly and lumping everybody together – so we say, “there’s a policy that covers women, LGBTQIA+, disability, race, religion” – but we know that these sweeping statements don’t work. Everybody is different, their needs are different and so we need to make sure we’re breaking it all down and talking about things on an issue by issue, person by person level. So I’m joined by another passionate group of professionals who are helping us shine a light on the issue of disability today.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>IN THIS EPISODE WE DISCUSS:</strong></h2>\n<p>[01.01] Introductions to our Blended panellists.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I’m a person who can’t see that is living in a world that has been set up for people who can – and that’s the same for all disabilities.” Scott</p></blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Scott – Director of Public Policy at Alphapointe</li>\n<li>Claudia – Senior Director of Global Logistics at Google</li>\n<li>Prakash – Multi Model Operations at Toll Group</li>\n<li>Doug – Program Manager in Workforce Development at NSITE</li>\n<li>Victor – Chair of Board of Directors for Clothing Pick Up for Cerebral Palsy and Board Director for The Ontario Federation of Cerebral Palsy</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“I can now say ‘I’m blind’ and I’m not cautious or ashamed. I encourage people that are going through the same thing, there’s a rainbow at the end, you can get through this and really succeed!” Doug</p></blockquote>\n<p>[11.52] The group reflect on what the word ‘disability’ means to them.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Disability is a very broad statement that actually disempowers a lot of people.” Prakash</p></blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>People first language</li>\n<li>The evolution of language</li>\n<li>What defines you as an individual</li>\n<li>Words mean different things to different people</li>\n<li>Developing more creative means of communication</li>\n<li>Breadth of what the word represents – not all disabilities are visible</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“I think it’s always safe to ask the person how they want to be referred to. In a situation where you’re not sure, it’s best to ask!” Claudia</p></blockquote>\n<p>[26.05] The guests share their personal experiences, both the challenges and the positives, and discuss some of the things they’ve learned from those experiences.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Creating safe spaces to educate and empower</li>\n<li>Normalizing conversations</li>\n<li>Making things accessible, from workplaces to websites</li>\n<li>Creating equal opportunities</li>\n<li>Honesty and visibility</li>\n<li>Systems, technologies and remote working</li>\n<li>The impact of COVID</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“I’m a strong believer that we need to do what it takes to get employers to look at people, to pay them real dollars and give them real jobs so everyone has an opportunity in life.” Victor</p></blockquote>\n<p>[52.00] The panel discuss different company procedures and approaches, and their impact.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“You need to educate people about inclusion – you can have an accessible washroom, but that doesn’t mean you’re welcoming people.” Victor</p></blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Holding leadership accountable</li>\n<li>Policies and targets</li>\n<li>Breaking the tendency to only employ people like yourself</li>\n<li>Training and awareness</li>\n<li>Company culture and structure</li>\n<li>Assumptions vs honest conversations</li>\n<li>Flexibility</li>\n<li>Accessibility vs inclusiveness</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“It’s not just about diversity, race, gender, disability – it’s the culture-add that you get. By adding people of different backgrounds and abilities, you get a stronger, richer, high performing team.” Claudia</p></blockquote>\n<p>[1.09.03] The group reflect on possible solutions for opening up dialogues in our businesses, guiding leaders to a more inclusive way of working and celebrating and promoting people with disabilities.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Creating the right environments</li>\n<li>Staff training</li>\n<li>Keeping an open mind and resisting assumptions</li>\n<li>Taking action and being committed</li>\n<li>Being an ally</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[1.20.22] The panellists each give their sum-up from today’s discussion around what we can we do to encourage diversity through disability. .</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don’t be scared to have the conversation, or ask the question – Prakash</li>\n<li>Don’t be afraid to step down and empower the person with the disability – Victor</li>\n<li>Promote awareness – Claudia</li>\n<li>Remember that with diversity comes opportunity – Doug</li>\n<li>Your future will be brighter and better when you find ways to engage with and include people with disabilities – Scott</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“We need more pressure on our HR staffing teams to make sure that we have a diverse slate of candidates – and that means all kinds of diversity.” Claudia</p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>RESOURCES AND LINKS MENTIONED:</strong></h2>\n<p>You can connect with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/scottthornhillnc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Scott</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/claudiaknowltonchike/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Claudia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/douglas-goist-656b3228/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Doug</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/prakash-m-radhakrishnan-4b048044/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Prakash</a> and Victor over on LinkedIn.</p>\n<p>Check out our other podcasts <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/podcast\">HERE</a>.</p>\n",

This extensive experience in product development, sourcing, textile research and development, led her to dive deeper into sustainability and supply chain, and she’s never looked back.</p>\n<p>Tara established her own sustainable womenswear brand in 2009, successfully running it for over 11 years, and went on to found Re:Source(d), a consultancy and education platform looking to demystify the world of sustainable fashion and textile sourcing. She’s an instructor at the Fashion Institute of Technology, as well as holding leadership roles at a sustainable fashion brand and fashion collaboration platform.</p>\n<p>Today Tara will be talking to us about her career so far, her love for fashion; her dedication to sustainability and shaping the future of ethical fashion; and she’ll be sharing her experiences as a woman in the industry, and her words of advice for all of those women following in her footsteps.</p>\n<h2><strong>SHOW SPONSOR:</strong></h2>\n<p>Apex Logistics are proud to sponsor Let’s Talk Supply Chain’s Women In Supply Chain™ podcast and blog series.

That was the first pivot towards sustainability.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[13.28] How and why Tara established her own sustainable womenswear brand, Study NY, as well as her consultancy, Re:Source(d), and what she learned along the way.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Sustainability isn’t a series of checkboxes, you can’t do everything.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[20.34] How packaging and technology ties into sustainability.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I see packaging as low hanging fruit for brands who want to start on their sustainability story… it’s the first touchpoint that most customers have with their product.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[26.25] The damaging impact of fast fashion, and why change is on the way.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Government and industry are starting to take the fashion industry more seriously.

So lets take what I learned in this industry… and take it to this industry who hasn’t done it yet.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[12.38] Exactly what Vizion does, and how it helps its customers.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“We were encountering, again and again, issues with the data foundations across international logistics. It was tough to get data, and if you could get it, it wasn’t coming through pipes that any modern tech systems would utilize. And then the data itself was fragmented and incomplete.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[18.24] The fundamental differences between API’s and EDI’s, and Kyle’s reflections on the pros and cons.</p>\n<p>[24.54] Why API’s are truly at the heart of digital transformation.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“API’s force better data quality.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[28.30] A closer look at the Vizion interface and pricing structure.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Using an API is the most flexible and close-to-instant way to put the information you need in the places and systems you want in the fastest possible time.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[33.17] From smallest to largest, why Vizion doesn’t necessarily have an ideal customer.</p>\n<p>[35.14] Key customer case studies demonstrating the different ways Vizion can help to solve business challenges, and deliver swift ROI.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Our customers know before their customers ask.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[39.18] The future for Vizion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>RESOURCES AND LINKS MENTIONED:</strong></h2>\n<p>Head over to Vizion’s <a href=\"https://vizionapi.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">website</a> now to find out more and discover how they could help you too.

This year has flown by – I’ve hosted some incredible guests and it’s been a real honor that they’ve opened up, and shared their stories with us – in a lot of cases they’ve been really sensitive, personal topics and yet they’ve thrown themselves into it with authenticity and humor so that, as a group, we’ve been able to start to break down stigma and create a safe space for people to ask questions, learn, grow and work through their own belief systems and experiences. We’ve tackled some huge topics – social inequality, racism, sexism, trans rights – and we don’t plan on stopping now!</p>\n<p>Today in episode 12, ‘Immigration and Identity,’ I’m joined by an amazing new group of supply chain and DEI professionals to tackle the, sometimes controversial, subject of immigration. I’ve interviewed so many first and second-generation immigrations on Let&#8217;s Talk Supply Chain™, and that aspect of the guest&#8217;s identity, more often than not, really helps to shape who they are as people, their ambition and aspirations. It’s always a fantastic talking point, so we thought it really deserved a show of its own. Our panelists share their personal journeys and we tackle the challenges and biases as well as the joys and successes of immigrant experiences.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>IN THIS EPISODE WE DISCUSS:</strong></h2>\n<p>[03.04] Introductions to our Blended panelists.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stefanie – Product Manger at Terminal 49</li>\n<li>Martha – Global Snr.

In partnership with the Business Spend Management (BSM) Community, Coupa is constantly co-creating new and unique capabilities that deliver transparency, efficiency, actionable insights and solutions to customers, partners and suppliers, so they can understand and manage their spending.</p>\n<p>Today Matt Tichon, Vice President of Industry Strategy at Coupa Software, joins me to chat all about the company; what they do; the impact of COVID on supply chain resiliency; and why innovation, collaboration and visibility are the keys to business success.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>IN THIS EPISODE WE DISCUSS:</strong></h2>\n<p>[3.34] A brief background on Coupa and Matt.</p>\n<p>[05.55] How Matt compares Camaro&#8217;s to supply chain.</p>\n<p>[9.05] Coupa&#8217;s key areas and how help their clients understand efficiencies.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“We allow companies to experiment&#8230; Instead of making a gut feel with a little bit of data, we can take a whole lot of data and say,<em> &#8216;what happens if?&#8217;</em> and we test these things out.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[12.26] The value of Digital Supply Chain Twin and how it can be a competitive advantage.</p>\n<p>[16.25] Matt&#8217;s thoughts on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“The question is, what do you do with your insights once you have them? 85% of data science projects fail. The trick is understanding to start with the end in mind.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[20.00] How different execution systems all come together.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“It is magic when you do this right! The value unlocks are massive and it&#8217;s not hard! I want the whole world to know that this is possible and it&#8217;s easy to do, and we&#8217;ll hold your hand getting there. You&#8217;re going to be amazed so just come on this journey!”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[23:36] Matt on Coupa&#8217;s &#8220;War Gaming&#8221; concept.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“It&#8217;s understanding different plays and what your supply chain will look like while your competitors haven&#8217;t even thought of what to do yet.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[29.02] Coupa&#8217;s perspective on nurturing resilience during and after COVID.</p>\n<p>[32.30] An ideal customer for Coupa.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“For food, once you get to 500 million dollars or more in revenue, they start to exhaust their team&#8217;s abilities and they come knocking on our door.

Her career has taken her around the world and seen her climb the ranks of supply chain leadership in huge brands like Chiquita. Ana Lucia is now bringing together everything she’s learned so far as VP of global supply chain at Starbucks.</p>\n<p>Today Ana Lucia will be talking to us about her career so far, her take on COVID demand and disruption, the importance of brands embracing sustainability; and she’ll be sharing her words of advice for all of the women following in her footsteps.</p>\n<h2><strong>SHOW SPONSOR:</strong></h2>\n<p>Apex Logistics are proud to sponsor Let’s Talk Supply Chain’s Women In Supply Chain™ podcast and blog series.

It encourages you to bring your whole self to work – and that makes a difference!”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[21.39] COVID, its impact on customer demand and supply chain disruption.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“We’re facing unpreceded volatility and uncertainty in all aspects, across supply and demand. But its amazing how supply chains across the world have stepped up.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[26.02] Ana Lucia’s final role at Chiquita, and why incorporating continuous improvement is the key to successful sustainability.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I had the opportunity to combine elements that make a difference for our environment, but at the same time still drive operational excellence – that’s so critical in sustained long-term solutions.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[29.24] The experiences and challenges that Ana Lucia faced as a Latina woman in a male-dominated world, and what she learned from them.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Most of the environments, for my studies and work, have been male-dominated. So in a way I’ve been used, most of my life, to being the minority in the room.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[34.02] The liberating moment Ana Lucia found her voice.</p>\n<p>[38.04] Why the future is bright for supply chain, and for Ana Lucia.</p>\n<p>[39.53] Ana Lucia’s words of advice to the next generation.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“It’s not about being perfect, but always being better.”</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<h2><strong>RESOURCES AND LINKS MENTIONED:</strong></h2>\n<p>You can connect with Ana Lucia over on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">LinkedIn</a>.</p>\n<p>Check out our other podcasts <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/podcast\">HERE</a>.</p>\n",

We’ve already featured some incredible panellists, who have really opened up, got deep, got vulnerable, and brought some amazing points of view to the table.</p>\n<p>We’ve talked about all sorts of issues – the differences between equality and diversity, the Black Lives Matter movement, the gender equation and last episode, we got real about workplace bullying. It was an emotional one at some points, but yet again, so valuable in opening up the kinds of conversations we need to have to bring visibility to key issues and encourage positive change.</p>\n<p>Today in Episode 9, ‘Handling Diversity in Business: Is there a right or wrong answer?’ Madison and I are joined by a new group of inspirational supply chain and DEI professionals who are passionate about people, about social issues in our industry and in the community at large; and they are going to share their insights and experiences with us to help shine a light on the huge topic of the right and wrong ways to handle diversity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>IN THIS EPISODE WE DISCUSS:</strong></h2>\n<p>[01.11] Introductions to our Blended panellists.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rob – CEO at Mercado Labs</li>\n<li>Joselina – Executive Board Member at Zora&#8217;s Cradle</li>\n<li>Kesha – National Diversity &amp; Inclusion Specialist</li>\n<li>Gabby – Principal Consultant at Inclusive Kind</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“Diversity should be a core value of every company: how you get there is as much art as it is science, but it should never not be the goal.” Rob</p></blockquote>\n<p>[07.01] The group share some personal stories of the wrong ways to handle diversity in the workplace and touch on the kinds of challenges we’re still facing in this area.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stereotypes and assumptions</li>\n<li>The role of ego</li>\n<li>Conforming and compliance</li>\n<li>Self-awareness, personal development and unconscious bias</li>\n<li>Good intentions vs being intentional</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“We should work with people with who they are and what they have to offer, and value that. Diverse teams outperform homogenous teams but many people, for whatever reason, are uncomfortable with what doesn’t look familiar.” Joselina</p></blockquote>\n<p>[24.36] The panellists take a closer look at the widespread corporate policy of target setting, and whether this challenges inequality and enhances diversity, or just further commoditises underrepresented groups.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Representation and diversity of thought</li>\n<li>Hiring vs retention</li>\n<li>Compliance and commitment</li>\n<li>Emphasis on employee experience</li>\n<li>Creating safe spaces</li>\n<li>Company vision and legacy</li>\n<li>Differing challenges based on company size and culture</li>\n<li>Goals vs targets</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“Diversity and equity work is very purposeful… you need to know where you started from and where you want to get to, so you need to know the numbers to ground that work.” Gabby</p></blockquote>\n<p>[42.09] The group consider the idea of box-ticking, and what that means for company policies and belief systems.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The language we use around DEI</li>\n<li>Policy vs empowerment</li>\n<li>Change management and transformation</li>\n<li>Finding the ‘why’ and tying into culture, mission and values</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[1.00.50] Madison reflects on her appointment as head of Belonging, Inclusion and Culture and the panellists think about the pros and cons of hiring a DEI figurehead.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Personal accountability, advocacy and driving awareness</li>\n<li>DEI as an almost daily evolution</li>\n<li>Authenticity</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“Retention is a piece of this equation too: how strong is the culture that enables diverse employees to bring their full selves to work?” Madison</p></blockquote>\n<p>[1.12.15] The panellists each give their sum-up from today’s discussion.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be kind – Rob</li>\n<li>Take action – Joselina</li>\n<li>Create equitable foundations, that support everything from fair wages to talent development – Kesha</li>\n<li>Remember that we have the power to re-design the workplace – Gabby</li>\n<li>Be unapologetically you – Madison</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“Integrate DEI into every facet of your organisation… make sure you have an equitable foundation that supports everyone.” Kesha</p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>RESOURCES AND LINKS MENTIONED:</strong></h2>\n<p>You can connect with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/madisonmobley/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Madison</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertwgarrison/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Rob</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/joselina-peralta/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Joselina</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrskeshspeaks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Kesha</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabby-zuniga/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Gabby</a> over on LinkedIn.</p>\n<p>Check out our other podcasts <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/podcast\">HERE</a>.</p>\n",

Back in 2016, a male co-host and I started a podcast called “Two Babes Talk Supply Chain.” But over time, things evolved. My co-host left the show, and when I launched the Women In Supply Chain™ series, I realized there were quite a few people who weren’t too keen on the name…!</p>\n<p>So in April 2018 I re-branded the show (within a week, which I still can’t quite believe!). Let’s Talk Supply Chain was born – and I haven’t looked back.</p>\n<p>This is the 200<sup>th</sup> episode, as Let’s Talk Supply Chain, and last month we celebrated our three year anniversary. Wow! The last three years have been filled with opportunities and conversations I could’ve only dreamed of. There have been so many highs and lows; times where I&#8217;ve doubted myself and times where I felt like I could take on the world! And it&#8217;s safe to say I&#8217;ve learnt a lot about the industry, and myself, along the way.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I’m proud of myself for persevering; I’m proud of the ideas I’ve taken and run with; I’m proud of myself for not giving up.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>And for the last year, I’ve grown some amazing connections – mostly virtual – and brought together a group of talented, smart and supportive people that have changed my life for the better.</p>\n<p>And that group includes the incredible <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sscuddermarketingstrategist/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Sarah Scudder</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/briansglick/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Brian Glick</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/alison-cusack/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Alison Cusack</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/madisonmobley/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Madison Mobley</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/larry-leung/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Larry Leung</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisafentoncscmp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Lisa Fenton</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dodeja/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Akshay Dodeja</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/angiereno/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Angie Reno</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-kempe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Jonathan Kempe</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/audrey-ross-citp-3422a153/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Audrey Ross</a>.</p>\n<p>In this episode, you’ll get a sneak peek into the banter, conversations and love that happens on our not-to-be-missed weekly happy hours. We’ve shared ideas, celebrated 40<sup>th</sup> birthdays, worked together, helped each other through lockdown and spurred each other on to do better, day after day.</p>\n<p>Today, they’ll be sharing stories, their favourite memories of me, asking me questions and so much more. So grab your tissues (it gets emotional!) and join my friends and I on this very special trip down memory lane as we celebrate Let’s Talk Supply Chain’s 200<sup>th</sup> episode.</p>\n<p data-wp-editing=\"1\">Sarah x</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p data-wp-editing=\"1\">Sarah is so approachable and engaging; helpful in reaching out and proving support, and a lot of times we don’t see that in a business setting.” Akshay</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-wp-editing=\"1\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5023\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_05-17-2021_13-36-51-2-300x140.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"370\" height=\"172\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_05-17-2021_13-36-51-2-300x140.jpg 300w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_05-17-2021_13-36-51-2-600x279.jpg 600w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_05-17-2021_13-36-51-2-768x357.jpg 768w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_05-17-2021_13-36-51-2.jpg 1023w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 370px) 100vw, 370px\" /></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p data-wp-editing=\"1\">“Sarah is so welcoming.

And we’re getting candid, and sometimes uncomfortable, so we can challenge the status quo together and help move the industry forward for everyone.</p>\n<p>Today in Episode 7, ‘Equality vs Diversity: What the Difference?,’ I’m joined by another group of amazing supply chain professionals who are passionate about the issues of equality and diversity and will be sharing their experiences, research and points of view with us, so we can open up this huge topic and tackle it head on.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>IN THIS EPISODE WE DISCUSS:</strong></h2>\n<p>[00.23] Introductions to our Blended panellists.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Julie – Manager Business Systems Analysis at AMD</li>\n<li>Adrian – Director of Procurement Strategy and Innovation at Help My Bid</li>\n<li>Sabrina – Contract Specialist for the U.S Army Corps of Engineers</li>\n<li>Julian – Vocational Expert and Career Counsellor</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“Diversity and inclusion means for me: treating everybody as a human being, with respect, kindness, humility and without judgement.” Julie</p></blockquote>\n<p>[04.34] The group discuss the difference between equality and diversity.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The nuances around the words equality, equity, diversity and inclusion.</li>\n<li>Can businesses build strategies to tackle the issues of equality and diversity if they don’t understand how they align with their core values?</li>\n<li>Has diversity replaced equality?</li>\n<li>Backing up intention with real action and policy.</li>\n<li>The layers within diversity and appreciating the different perspectives behind the person.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“Are we holding our standards up to what our core values are, things like transparency, ethics, responsibility – so when you talk about equality does it all mesh and align?” Sabrina</p></blockquote>\n<p>[18.29] The panellists reflect on what the picture of diversity looks like at company level.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Diversity targets and percentages.</li>\n<li>Where is the diversity located within the company – what are the levels of influence, and who are the decision makers?</li>\n<li>The importance of continuing to learn and improve.</li>\n<li>Does diversity policy actually represent everyone?</li>\n<li>The risk of alienating certain groups, by accident, whilst championing others.</li>\n<li>Fear of change.</li>\n<li>The need for people to be uncomfortable.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“If we’re all going to enjoy this place we’re creating, we all need to give a little.

When we can get to a place of treating everybody on their own merit, then the chance for racism minimizes because we’re treating everyone as an individual.” Julian</p></blockquote>\n<p>[57.09] The panellists discuss the term ‘white privilege.’</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Does white privilege exist?</li>\n<li>Understanding the phrase – is it positive, negative or neutral?</li>\n<li>How do we use privilege for good?</li>\n<li>The importance of auditing privilege and being proactive about dismantling structures that give you privilege whilst subjugating others.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“White privilege just means that your race doesn’t put you at a disadvantage in society, but people get very wrapped up in the polarity of that phrase.” Sabrina</p></blockquote>\n<p>[1.13.38] The group give their ideas on how to start to create practical change, within the workforce and the wider community.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Conduct self-study, research, ask questions and have open conversations from the heart.</li>\n<li>Be deliberate in your actions towards creating equity.</li>\n<li>Start with the people you already have in your workforce and ask them how they could be better heard and included.</li>\n<li>Remove unconscious bias from the hiring process.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“We are living experiences all at the same time, but we’re experiencing the same situation in different ways.” Adrian</p></blockquote>\n<p>[1.24.36] The panellists each give their sum-up for creating meaningful change.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be intentional – Adrian</li>\n<li>Be authentic – Julie</li>\n<li>Be human – Julian</li>\n<li>Listen – Sabrina</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“Unless you audit what you’re doing, and you’re intentional about your action, it won’t change – just having the people in the room doesn’t make any difference.” Adrian</p></blockquote>\n<h2><strong>RESOURCES AND LINKS MENTIONED:</strong></h2>\n<p>You can connect with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/julieshum/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Julie</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrian-betton-mcips-chartered-b-eng-8bb2564/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Adrian</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sabrina-booker-b57584123/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Sabrina</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/julian-shields-m-s-crc-8138a5132/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Julian</a> over on LinkedIn.</p>\n<p>Check out our other podcasts HERE.</p>\n",

She’s had an impressively long-standing and diverse career, working in software, marketing and research for some big industry names from Proctor &amp; Gamble to Kraft, before breaking away and starting her own firm, <a href=\"https://supplychaininsights.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Supply Chain Insights</a>, in 2012.</p>\n<p>Through Supply Chain Insights, Lora works with supply chain leaders to take teams to higher levels of excellence.

It’s direct action and opportunities for people that look like me.” Shay</p></blockquote>\n<p>[09.23] How Devon’s experiences drove her to shine a light on the common traumas of indigenous women and found SheNative, to inspire and support others.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Indigenous women are some of the most disadvantaged women in Canada &#8211; we&#8217;re five times more likely to go missing and to be murdered; we&#8217;re 3% of Canada&#8217;s population, yet 30% of the prison population.&#8221;</p>\n<p>[16.51] Shay’s ‘rags to riches’ childhood, and how that journey shaped the woman she is today.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Starting a business will expose a lot of your trauma, and people don’t always talk about that.” Shay.</p></blockquote>\n<p>[22.53] Why Mike’s experiences led him towards helping others and creating Procurement Foundry, a community for people in the industry to come together, learn and grow.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“The people that are willing to expose their backgrounds and do a deep search into themselves to figure out where they came from, can ultimately say ‘now I know who I am today.’”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[30.04] How Addy’s experience of growing up in Nigeria instilled her with an intense desire to succeed.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Since I started my career, I was always the only woman, and the only black person – there was never anybody who looked like me.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[41.43] Why Tzvete’s multicultural upbringing and ambitious parents, as well as her desire to inspire her younger sister, were the key to her success.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Being in such an international culture at a young age opened my perspective and showed me that there are so many different types of cultures and customs &#8211; and it taught me how to adapt.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[50.20] The panellists reflections on young people in business.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lack of encouragement, low self-esteem and the importance of mentors</li>\n<li>Experience, knowledge, opportunity and giving the benefit of the doubt</li>\n<li>Inspiration, influence and visibility of positive role models</li>\n<li>Access to the right networks and communities</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[1.06.11] The panellists take a closer look at diversity and inclusion.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Conferences: a lack of diverse speakers, financial drivers and the emphasis on job titles</li>\n<li>Looking at diversity at a team level</li>\n<li>The issue with big business ticking diversity and inclusion boxes without truly committing to change</li>\n<li>The downstream impact of supplier diversity</li>\n<li>Barriers to becoming a diverse supplier, eg issues with long term sustainability, scaling and access to capital</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[1.15.20] Creating meaningful change.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Find your niche and be the best at what you do</li>\n<li>Build something for yourself, outside of the corporate environment</li>\n<li>The importance of diverse investors</li>\n<li>The importance of mentorship for diverse SME’s</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[1.22.19] The panellists sum up their key piece of advice from today’s discussion.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Diversity and inclusion only makes your company better: hear and respect their voices – Addy</li>\n<li>Put your money where your mouth is – engage with, and invest in, diverse businesses – Devon</li>\n<li>Just start – Mike</li>\n<li>Be aware – Tzvete</li>\n<li>Don’t be intimidated and once you’ve reached your destination, go back and carve out that path for others to follow – Shay</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>RESOURCES AND LINKS MENTIONED:</strong></h2>\n<p>You can connect with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/devon-fiddler/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Devon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaylynndixon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Shay</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-cadieux/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Mike</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/adeola-d-olubamiji-ph-d-42bb0b116/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Addy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tdoncheva/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Tzvete</a> over on LinkedIn.</p>\n<p>Check out our other podcasts <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/podcast\">HERE</a>.</p>\n",

From product creation and tracking, to document management and shipment, to order collaboration and smart tagging, their platform has everything you need for the first mile of your supply chain.</p>\n<p>And when it comes to the middle mile, you need Shipz Inc; the innovative new bid-and-ship freight platform. Working to simplify the complexity often found in logistics, the Shipz platform closes the gap between mid-market shippers and forwarders, creating an accessible and hassle-free logistics solution for all. From quick and accurate quotes, selecting the right partners that fit your business, secure documentation all in one place and even lines of credit, shippers and forwarders will see a variety of benefits by connecting with the Shipz platform.</p>\n<p>I’m joined by Rob Garrison, CEO at Mercado, to talk about why collaboration in business is so important, the impact of the pandemic, the vast array of benefits that collaboration can bring – and the new and exciting partnership between Shipz and Mercado, coming for 2021.</p>\n<h2><strong>IN THIS EPISODE WE DISCUSS:</strong></h2>\n<p>[06.18] Why collaboration is so important in supply chain.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“International supply chain is not only a mile wide, it’s a mile deep – and that’s the fundamental reason why collaboration is so important.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[13.01] An overview of Mercado and Shipz.</p>\n<p>[15.37] How collaboration can help businesses to extend their offering by filling in their gaps with a third party.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“As a customer… there are a lot of companies coming up and it’s not always clear exactly who they are and what their competency is. So Shipz Inc’s ability to diagnose those issues and connect them through the platform is a huge benefit.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[20.55] The benefit collaboration has with regard to data and insights.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“If you’ve got all the data in one source, you can give much richer reporting and much richer insight.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[21.54] How collaboration can help expand businesses, helping them to operate successfully on both a local and a global scale.</p>\n<p>[25.22] Why Shipz is an important partner for Mercado.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Whilst we’re experts in the first mile, it doesn’t mean we should ignore the rest of the supply chain and it’s great to be able to say to a customer, I have a great partner that can do that for you.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[28.10] The role good partnerships played in keeping businesses afloat in 2020, and the impact on the industry as a whole.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“The world suddenly shifted – the pandemic accelerated plans from ‘over the next 10 years’ to ‘over the next 2 years;’ it was that rapid. Businesses had to rely on collaboration in order to survive.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[33.00] A look at Mercado’s new <em>Transform</em> campaign.</p>\n<p>[39.11] An introduction to how Mercado and Shipz are collaborating in 2021.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>RESOURCES AND LINKS MENTIONED:</strong></h2>\n<p>Head over to Mercado’s <a href=\"https://mercadolabs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">website</a> to find out more and discover how they could help you too.

His passion, dedication and talent has led him to become the go-to for the transportation &amp; logistics sectors’ coaching and sales training.</p>\n<p>He began selling transportation &amp; logistics services in 1994, quickly climbing the ranks, winning sales competitions and growing businesses, before the impact of the recession in 2008 led him to confront his mentality and approach to business. In 2012, he established High-Performance Logistics Sales and has become a sales and coaching guru, in demand across the logistics industry.</p>\n<p>Today Dan will be talking to us about his business, his journey to success and why freight providers need to get on board with high level sales performance, fast!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>IN THIS EPISODE WE DISCUSS:</strong></h2>\n<p>[04.43] Dan’s background, how he fell into supply chain and discovered a love for sales.</p>\n<p>[10.15] The highs and lows of the journey that led Dan to establish High-Performance Logistics Sales.</p>\n<p>[17.30] The issues Dan identified within the industry that helped guide him to founding HPLS.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I realized there was a major gap, in transportation and logistics, in training.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[21.56] From online one-to-ones to group coaching, the many and varied ways Dan can help sales people to reach their goals.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“If you want to get into that top 2%, it’s a career, not a job.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[27.22] Why, historically, sales performance training in logistics hasn’t been something that most freight providers have embraced.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Businesses are worried that if they train people up, they’ll leave. And I say ‘well, what if you don’t train them, and they stay?!’”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[31.03] A real life case study of how Dan helped revolutionize one customers sales strategy.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“If we don’t have three key areas – clarity about what we want, an intention about getting it, and mastering the critical skills to get us there – we’re always going to be a generalist.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[34.13] The ideal client profile for High-Performance Logistics Sales.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“If they’re dedicated and want this as a career – I can take care of everything else.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[38.31] The future for Dan, and for High-Performance Logistics Sales</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>RESOURCES AND LINKS MENTIONED:</strong></h2>\n<p>Head over to Dan’s <a href=\"http://www.dandeigan.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">website</a> now to find out more and discover how he could help you too.</p>\n<p>You can also connect with him on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dandeiganhpls/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-deigan-07915b3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">LinkedIn</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/dandeiganhpls/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Instagram</a> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DanDeigan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Twitter</a>; check out his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC372grKFxIhv6Fzbr3ZIJnQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">YouTube</a> channel; or even listen to his podcast on <a href=\"https://www.dandeigan.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">iTunes</a>.</p>\n<p>Check out our other podcasts <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/podcast/\">HERE</a>.</p>\n",

are there right or wrong words to use, and what are the subtexts of those words; and what does diversity, inclusion and identity mean to us.</p>\n<p><strong>IN THIS EPISODE WE DISCUSS:</strong></p>\n<p>[03.29] Introductions to our Blended panelists.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prakash M Radhakrishnan – Courier Operations at Toll and award-winning YouTube producer with a focus on disability and mental health.</li>\n<li>Holly Qualman – VP of Marketing and Client Solutions America for Apex Logistics and adopted Korean-American woman, flying the flag for multi-racial unity.</li>\n<li>Matthew Hernandez – General Manger for North America at Xenata and representative of both the LatinX and LGBTQIA communities.</li>\n<li>Hope White – Founder and CEO of HD White Logistics, Founder of Hope White Consulting and Logistically Speaking Online and proud black woman.</li>\n<li>Greg White – Founder of Blue Ridge Global, host of Supply Chain Now and father of daughters, with native American heritage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[11.23] The word ‘minority’ and its connotations.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“It’s time to think about the world on a global scale.” Greg.</p></blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Is it a beneficial or derogatory term?</li>\n<li>Does it perpetuate the feeling of being ‘other’ or ‘less than,’ since its technical definition is less than half the whole?</li>\n<li>How does the insistence on labelling people affect mental health and self-esteem?</li>\n<li>How does being a minority affect your goals and ambitions – are they personal to you, or are they developed so you can conform to a societal norm?</li>\n<li>Are we designed to keep each other at arm’s length; is the tendency towards segregation a result of evolution – how do we push the reset button on human nature?</li>\n<li>Are labels necessary at all, or are we all just people?</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“It’s another stage of evolution – before we develop the language for it, we need to understand how we got here.” Matthew.</p></blockquote>\n<p>[33.20] What words should we be using specifically for the disability community?</p>\n<blockquote><p>“There’s no rulebook – and the disability community feel the same.” Prakash</p></blockquote>\n<p>[36.10] The impact of upbringing.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why the way that we’re raised is so vital – prejudice is learnt, or tackled, at an early age.</li>\n<li>Why we need to support everyone to succeed, and make sure that those at a disadvantage get equal if not greater support.</li>\n<li>The danger in not taking on board peoples experiences and viewpoints because of preconceptions.</li>\n<li>How the use of incorrect labels muddies the water and creates confusion.</li>\n<li>Assumption is ignorance: the importance of being able to continue to interpret and learn.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[44.12] What words should we be using specifically for the LGBTQIA community and people of color?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why it’s important to take the time to listen.</li>\n<li>How some words have traditionally been used to separate minorities and make them ‘an other.’</li>\n<li>Why education is so important.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[55.28] The importance of identity.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“It’s not what you’re called, it’s what you answer to.” Hope</p></blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Why we all need to be in charge of our own identities.</li>\n<li>How descriptors have changed over time and the impact that those changes have had.</li>\n<li>Why it’s OK to ask, as long as you’re asking for the right reason.</li>\n<li>Why we need to pay attention to the nuances of individual identities.</li>\n<li>The responsibility of minorities to educate others.</li>\n<li>The importance of open and honest conversations, that come from a place of empathy and understanding.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[69.09] Today’s buzzwords: diversity and inclusion.</p>\n<blockquote><p>So many of us minorities have to jump through so many hoops just to get a small slither of the pie.” Hope</p></blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>What do these words mean to us?</li>\n<li>Can you have one without the other?</li>\n<li>How the meaning of diversity and inclusion can be influenced by how we’re raised, or what we’re exposed to on a long-term basis.</li>\n<li>Why diversity and inclusion also need to include processes to build the foundations for education and understanding and promoting acceptance.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p><em>Often in the corporate world, we know there’s a problem, but we very seldom have the opportunity to talk about it openly.” Matthew</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>[80.16] Our summaries of ‘what’s in a name.’</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep an open mind – Holly</li>\n<li>Everyone has a story – Hope</li>\n<li>Don’t be scared to ask the question – Prakash</li>\n<li>Take some time to self-reflect – Matthew</li>\n<li>Seek first to understand – Greg</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Check out our other podcasts <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/podcast/\">HERE</a>.</p>\n",

We talked about the latest technological advances in the industry and really did a deep dive into the importance of quality, right from the outset, and how it’s achieved through honesty, communication, collaboration and partnership.</p>\n<p>And today, last but <em>definitely</em> not least, we’re headed to the multi-billion-dollar world of beauty.

What’s the cost of customer dissatisfaction?” (MMK)</p></blockquote>\n<p>[26.25] How consumer behavior is driving supply chain optimization.<br />\n[29.30] How social media, communication speed and influencer impact can have a very positive, or negative, effect on your brand – making quality even more important.<br />\n[31.29] SQA’s ‘Quality Is’ campaign and how it helps customers to ensure quality is an accessible and better understood topic.<br />\n[35.08] Why designing quality into the supply chain from the beginning is going to be vital to the future of the beauty industry.</p>\n<p>You can connect with Mike on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-mckay-11a022a/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">LinkedIn</a>, or head over to SQA’s <a href=\"http://www.sqaservices.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">website</a> now to find out more, meet the team and discover how they could help you too.<br />\nYou can also connect with Ashley on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashleygoldberg/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">LinkedIn</a> or find out all about the different facets to <a href=\"https://www.merzusa.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Merz</a> on their website.</p>\n<p>Check out our other podcasts <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/podcast/\">HERE</a></p>\n",

They help companies working in the apparel, furnishing and fashion accessories industries take control of their supply chain and cut out unnecessary middlemen.</p>\n<p>Ram explains that when it comes to production, 70% of processes happen in a factory. But brands have no idea what happens in the factories: they can’t tell if workers are paid fair wages, if working conditions are at the right standard or whether the product is manufactured according to the specific requirements. SKUteam help brands track every section of the supply chain works by offering a whole range of services including accounting and finance, inspections, audits and inventory planning.</p>\n<p>With trends such as globalization and events such as Covid-19, brands want to move away from China and manufacture products elsewhere – but they aren’t sure where to go next. SKUteam helps brands find the appropriate factories and sample inventory. They then manage the audits, inspections and factory management. As Ram says, the future of supply chain is about removing human involvement. With SKUteam’s product, brands can be at the forefront of their industry simply by reducing costs and sourcing effectively.</p>\n<p><b>In this episode we discuss:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>[6.48] What influenced Ram to create SKUteam</li>\n<li>[11.51] What SKUteam does</li>\n<li>[17.48] How SKUteam helps customers throughout Covid</li>\n<li>[31.29] What their ideal client looks like</li>\n<li>[37.57] The future for SKUteam</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Resources and links mentioned:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.skuteam.com/#Hero\" data-et-has-event-already=\"true\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SKUteam</a></li>\n<li>Promo: refer Lets talk supply chain when you reach out to SKUTEAM!!

With their patented technology, Resilinc can produce simulations of potential catastrophes and help customers and suppliers mitigate risk.</p>\n<p>What is supply chain mapping? Ranna explains that supply chain mapping is about knowing who your tier 1, tier 2 and tier 3 suppliers are. Mapping is about knowing the full flow of your supply chain and therefore being able to successfully identify any points of failure. Large scale events such as Covid and have proved the importance of knowing how your entire supply chain works and being proactive rather than reactive.</p>\n<p>Ranna has worked in supply chain for 20 years, and says the industry has come very far. Thanks to advances in technology, companies can use data to prepare and handle risk efficiently. With more natural disasters happening every year, this is more relevant than ever. She also explains that the future of supply chain will involve more transparency and an even greater ability to connect directly customers with suppliers. Ranna loves her job as supply chain manager and she highly recommends it to anyone who wants a career that involves building strategic relationships, understanding how cultures work and international travel.</p>\n<p><b>In this episode we discuss:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>[0.30] Who is Resilinc?</li>\n<li>[2.55] What is supply chain mapping?</li>\n<li>[11.28] What Ranna loves about supply chain</li>\n<li>[16.55] How supply chain has changed in the past 20 years</li>\n<li>[27.14] Advice to young women interested in supply chain</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Resources and links mentioned:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.resilinc.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Resilinc</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

For our Women In Supply Chain™ spotlight for July, sponsored by <a href=\"https://alloy.ai\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Alloy</a>,  Melody tells us what her journey in supply chain has been like, what keeps her motivated and her plans for the future.</p>\n<p>Supply chain is constantly changing and advancing – yet many companies are sticking to manual processes. Although they recognise and understand the need for analytics, companies still use spreadsheets and adopting technology at a very slow pace. As Melody says, it’s almost like companies don’t believe the right tools are out there and that manual is more efficient. As someone who works in commercial software, Melody knows there is still a lot of work to do.</p>\n<p>What does success mean to Melody? To her, it means being in control of her destiny and being in a position to help others. She is driven by being surrounded by intellectuals who are eager to solve problems by tinkering and continuously testing. To others who are looking to get into a career in supply chain, Melody says: figure out what gets you motivated in the long haul and make sure to try as many different parts of supply chain as possible: after all, you won’t know what you like unless you try it!</p>\n<p><b>In this episode we discuss:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>[8.14] How Melody fell into supply chain</li>\n<li>[14.48] What success means to her</li>\n<li>[15.43] The conversations she’s having in supply chain tech</li>\n<li>[25.20] Advice to people looking at supply chain as a career</li>\n<li>[34.04] A moment when Melody had to take a leap of faith</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Resources and links mentioned:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://alloy.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-schema-attribute=\"\">Alloy</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00W3SYQFC/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Dynamic Supply Chain Book</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Stay Connected with the Podcast:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Find us at <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/\">Let’s Talk Supply Chain</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/women-in-supply-chain/wisc-podcast/\">Women In Supply Chain™ Series</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Supply chain still needs to be properly disrupted, and Mercado believes a marketplace is the key forward.</p>\n<p>Why is supply chain not disrupted yet? Rob explains that the complexity of supply chain is daunting and the combination of various processes makes it difficult to innovate as a whole. Many companies that claim to resolve an issue using tech only solve one specific piece of the puzzle. With Mercado, Rob and Lee want to fix the problem by transferring the entire “puzzle” online.</p>\n<p>Rob believes that the best place to fix an issue is at the beginning: the purchase order. The first mile is what needs digitizing first – and it’s often the most inefficient part of the process. Imagine if every time you ordered a burger at McDonald’s the workers had to go back and forth between you and the kitchen to get your order right? This is what is currently happening in the supply chain world.

What does their process look like? They ask a lot of questions, build a bespoke solution and then train every stakeholder that’s part of the operation. They live and breathe digital and are revolutionizing the relationship between drivers, paper and staff.</p>\n<p>According to Jason, the top three challenges in supply chain are data, systems and analytics. As a supply chain solutions company, MacGregor Partners knows how hard it actually is to implement data correctly, and how to build systems that don’t end up siloed. For this reason, they focus on Warehouse Management System (WMS) combined with analytics and visibility. MacGregor Partners’ typical clients are companies that are interested in technology and are looking for ways to implement software to optimize their distribution center.</p>\n<p>At MacGregor Partners, Jason and his team are “dethinkers”: they don’t overthink data and focus on the journey. Their design process is very hands-on, with the team only moving onto the next functional area once the previous one has been completed and confirmed by the customer – this allows them to be much more agile and adaptable to unexpected shocks, such as Covid-19. In the future, MacGregor Partners will be focused on delivering better products, more experiments and an even more cost-efficient methodology.</p>\n<p><b>In this episode we discuss:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>[0.35] MacGregor Partners, where it all began</li>\n<li>[12.15] The nitty-gritty of what they do</li>\n<li>[17.55] Top 3 challenges in supply chain</li>\n<li>[23.15] How does the customer benefit?</li>\n<li>[33.25] The future of the company</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Resources and links mentioned:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://macgregorpartners.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-schema-attribute=\"\">MacGregor Partners</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

The Covid crisis has brought a pivotal moment on Earth for everyone, and therefore an opportunity to accelerate important trends.</p>\n<p>As Greg says, necessity is the mother of innovation; with the crisis, supply chain is on everyone’s mind and companies are now serious about changing. As Scott declares, now is the time to seize the moment. Organizations are now more willing to challenge norms and be disruptive. As Scott and Greg explain, companies need to embrace the startup spirit: taking action, being disruptive (instead of disrupted) and giving authority to the people on the front line. The old way of working is slowly dying out, and those that resist change will die out with it.</p>\n<p>Greg believes that what’s most important is being humble enough to learn something new every day and being patient. Scott says that it’s important to remember that passion is not enough, that what entrepreneurs really need is obsession. In order to make a company work, you need to be willing to risk it all. Finally, Sarah reiterates that in order for effective collaboration to take place, large companies need to bring down barriers and make it easy for startups to work with them. And of course, at the end of the day, the most important is understanding what it is that a customer wants from you.</p>\n<p><b>In this episode we discuss:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>[4.01] How to stay innovative</li>\n<li>[13.10] Embracing the startup spirit</li>\n<li>[21.40] How to really rebrand</li>\n<li>[38.37] The importance of failing</li>\n<li>[54.52] Main takeaways</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Resources and links mentioned:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://supplychainnowradio.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Supply Chain Now</a></li>\n<li>Upcoming Twitter Chat Follow #SCSuperTrends from 2pm to 3pm EST <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LetsTalkSChain\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">@LetsTalkSChain</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://supplychainnowradio.com/episode-307/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Super Trend #1</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/ep-111-end-to-end-supply-chain-dead-or-alive/\">Super Trend #2</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://supplychainnowradio.com/episode-355\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Super Trend #3</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

Her career has taken her from Ireland, to Australia, China and finally California. She started her work in travel management and eventually fell in love with designing business systems, logistics and leveraging technology to improve supply chain.</p>\n<p>Thanks to her upbringing, Diane isn’t someone who shies away from making her voice heard and being a leader. Early on in her career she worked hard to create a culture where the team provided regular feedback which in turn helped her become a better leader. Her objective has always been to find someone to replace her position once she moves on, so the team can thrive without her.</p>\n<p>To Diane, success is her client’s success. This is what gives her a sense of fulfillment and encourages her to keep working. Her advice to other leaders is to hire people who have initiative, who are ambitious and inherently curious. She also places a lot of emphasis on being able to admit mistakes, and knowing that one cannot grow without first making mistakes. Finally, on diversity, Diane believes in picking the right candidate rather than scoring “diversity points”. Instead, she focuses on fostering open communication with other women.</p>\n<p><b>In this episode we discuss:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>[0.52] Diane’s goes global</li>\n<li>[4.40] How she adapted to working in different countries</li>\n<li>[6.44] Finding your voice</li>\n<li>[18.42] The importance of feedback</li>\n<li>[24.07] Advice for other leaders</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Resources and links mentioned:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.omnichains.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Omnichain</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/women-in-supply-chain/wisc-podcast/\">Women In Supply Chain™ Series</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

When it comes to <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/sea-2-ep-52-marketing-supply-chain-for-the-business-win/\">marketing</a> in the traditional world of Industrial manufacturing many companies see marketing as a cost center rather than an investment. This means marketing budgets are given low priority, especially during a recession when in reality marketing should be at the forefront of any strategy because it will set you apart from your competitors and keep your brand top of mind. In the long run, this ends up being more expensive, since companies need to start from ground zero when the market picks up. Only some companies are realising that marketing is the key to future success – especially when trying to get through a revenue plateau.</p>\n<p>Christopher realised this was an issue and started helping more industrial companies with their marketing. His system focuses on creating momentum, producing value and building a community before launching a product or asking customers to buy. Consistency and the long play is what sets one marketing strategy apart from the rest, marketing should work hand in hand with sales to keep the leads flowing in. Sales should be encouraged to showcase their thought leadership online with the help of the marketing team and together the business will have a winning strategy.</p>\n<p>Christopher is a big believer in social and uses social media such as Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn (3 hashtags!) as a platform to educate, entertain and build up a consistent brand image. As consumer behaviors keep shifting, more industrial companies will have no choice but to turn to more effective marketing in order to gain a competitive edge.</p>\n<p>Christopher is also the leader in the profile rings you see on Linkedin, he gave back to the supply chain community by doing this for professionals for free to stand out, in a time of so much noise its efforts like these that will be the most rewarded</p>\n<p>In this episode we discuss:</p>\n<p>● [0.35] Industrial Manufacturing<br />\n● [4.46] Top challenges in the industry<br />\n● [11.59] Winning marketing strategy<br />\n● [16.35] How different platforms provide communication opportunities<br />\n● [23.00] The carbon footprint of manufacturing companies</p>\n<p>Resources and links mentioned:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nesbitmarketing.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Nesbit Marketing</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-nesbit/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Christopher Nesbit</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

In today’s Women In Supply Chain™ series, Anju tells us how she got into supply chain, the valuable lessons she learnt from failure and why it’s important to put a focus on diversity.</p>\n<p>Anju moved from working in the corporate world at Oracle to a fast paced beauty startup. She was passionate about understanding the various pieces, solving business problems and growing both as a person and in her career. She says it’s important to be flexible, say yes to opportunities and be willing to take a leap into the unknown; this is what got her to where she is now.</p>\n<p>Our world has never been so diverse and inclusive, and yet there is still a lot of work to do. Anju explains why it’s important to have role models to look up to, and that in order to move the needle of diversity we need to encourage more discussions, be aware of our biases and lead with empathy. Her advice to other Women In Supply Chain™: think about what you want out of your career and be willing to pursue your dream.

It is probably very manual, lots of paperwork and different stakeholders involved making it impossible to be be agile and efficient. Because of that I thought it was important to introduce you to a company that is revolutionizing this. Andrew is the CEO of ShelfAware, a company that helps suppliers see in real-time what is on their customers’ shelves through hardware tracking RFID technology. This technology allows companies to see the exact moment a customer takes an item off the shelf, how many items they take and how much is needed to replenish stock.</p>\n<p>Using RFID technology together with real-time software means that suppliers can easily replenish stock without worrying about waste, workers don’t have to waste time counting items and companies can gather data on their customer habits. From a cost effective standpoint, everyone wins. ShelfAware works as a 3rd party SaaS (Software as a service), so they don’t need to touch the product at any point in the supply chain. The software connects with a tracking code that can easily be printed by the supplier and is put on the product itself.</p>\n<p>Who is ShelfAware’s ideal client? As Andrew says, he keeps discovering new industries this system could be useful for. They started with industrial suppliers and manufacturers, but anyone from a dentist to a large scale conglomerate can make use of their product and software. Andrew has helped businesses drastically lower inventory without losing the rate at which they replenish items. Once again, this is proof that collaborating with other companies can make them stronger together.</p>\n<p>Lastly we get a sneak peek into Andrew’s new show on The SC Supply Chain TV on Youtube called <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210414102838/https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFKDRuq7tnIpqbOeCBIARjzneFTRlXAF8\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">From the Frontlines</a> where he brings us into the frontlines of business, entrepreneurship and supply chain!</p>\n<p><strong>In this episode we discuss:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>[0.37] The story behind ShelfAware</li>\n<li>[6.50] Why RFID is so under-utilized</li>\n<li>[17.10] Who should consider RFID</li>\n<li>[21.17] Does it actually work in real life scenarios?</li>\n<li>[30.20] From the Frontlines</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Resources and links mentioned:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://shelfawarevmi.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ShelfAware</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

From the very beginning, the company focused on customer centricity and invested most of its resources into R&amp;D. Now, Alloy helps everything from small companies to Fortune 500s optimize their supply chain by connecting their data to customer demand. Focusing on customer experience for not only their customers but their customers, customer has been their key to success in this very competitive landscape of supply chain technology.</p>\n<p>The main challenge when it comes to retail supply chain is the huge shift in consumer habits, partly due to e-commerce. Nowadays, consumers expect a seamless customer experience, an infinite amount of stock and personalized offers. However, realizing that that there is a direct mis match between customer demands and retail distribution, Alloy were really able to dive deep into this challenge and come up with solutions that are not seen on the market yet, that is why they have a growing base of some of the biggest names in retail. Alloy really wants to make sure that their clients supply chains are giving them a competitive advantage and they do that by helping retailers coordinate all the different moving parts of their supply chain.</p>\n<p>The landscape and technology is constantly evolving, so how does a startup like Alloy adapt? You guessed it: <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/podcast/\">collaboration</a>. Right from the beginning Alloy was partnering with companies and made sure to be grounded to real world problems. As the number of partners and clients increased, the more they were able to take a holistic approach to resolving their clients’ pain points. Alloy’s future involves more effort on the data side through R&amp;D, and more specialization of every element of the supply chain.</p>\n<p><strong>In this episode we discuss:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>[0.29] Who is Alloy?</li>\n<li>[9.45] Consumer Habits driving supply chain</li>\n<li>[18.09] A customer success story</li>\n<li>[25.18] Data and Collaboration</li>\n<li>[30.10] The future for Alloy</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Resources and links mentioned:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://alloy.ai/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Alloy</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

Scott, Greg and Sarah have a lively discussion about whether we are seeing the death of the end-to-end supply chain. You will also hear about how the circular economy and supply chain is the answer plus how the role of sustainability will play out with consumers and the future of consumerism.</p>\n<p>Organizations have spent a lot of time and money trying to perfect their <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/the-time-is-now-for-retailers-to-future-proof-their-supply-chains-with-a-cohesive-approach-for-end-to-end-replenishment-planning/\">end to end supply chain</a>, but Greg says the circular supply chain is here to stay. The circular supply chain consists mainly of turning waste into opportunity. As the world’s resources become increasingly limited, companies are having to look for other ways to source and distribute their products and services. This, together with a huge shift in consumer behaviour towards sustainable practices, means companies will soon have no other option but to adopt a circular mindset.</p>\n<p>How can companies adopt a more sustainable supply chain? Sarah talks about collaborating with startups in order to find innovative solutions and challenge the status quo. Scott and Greg talk about the importance of changing mindsets and focusing on customer experience. This includes encouraging suppliers to take on more responsibility and looking for materials that are economically viable, sustainable and convenient for the customer (like 3D printing, for example). Companies should put more effort into building a brand and communicating their concept and vision, as well as identifying specific ambitions and building business cases. Some best practices include educating employees, finding the right KPIs and being willing to “do good” and talk about it.</p>\n<p><strong>In this episode we discuss:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>[1.15] End to End has been costly</li>\n<li>[12.26] Consumer behavior pushes for circular</li>\n<li>[26.40] Circular mindset shift</li>\n<li>[30.11] The key drivers to success</li>\n<li>[36.55] Best practices for a circular economy</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Resources and links mentioned:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://supplychainnowradio.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Supply<u> Chain Now</u></a></li>\n</ul>\n",

Since then, Angie has continuously sought career growth and built extensive experience within the industry. Featuring Angie in our “<a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/women-in-supply-chain/wisc-podcast/\">Women In Supply Chain™</a>” series has a personal significance to Sarah and is a career highlight for Angie with all her hard work in helping to close the gender gap. In this episode, Angie talks about the guidance she received from her father, why she is passionate about this industry and how the people make all the difference.</p>\n<p>Angie’s main challenge in supply chain was the pushback she got from colleagues and coworkers when she advocated for change and innovation. Angie knows that disruption is what encourages progress, but it can be difficult to implement when leaders are being pulled in so many different directions. As a woman in supply chain she has worked hard to challenge the status quo at all times in her career in order to encourage more diversity amongst male and female leaders.</p>\n<p>What’s her advice for the younger generation? She explains that it’s worth exploring the different partnerships your universities may offer. Be willing to go to conferences and reach out to leaders, look for ways to optimize the supply chain ecosystem and consider getting into cyber security. As she says, there is a shortage of talent and therefore many opportunities for students looking to get into the industry. For Angie herself, the future is focused on finding a healthy work balance and driving innovation forward.</p>\n<p><strong>In this episode we discuss:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>[2.41] Sweats and the CEO of Maersk</li>\n<li>[7.53] Taking some major risks</li>\n<li>[11.30] Overcoming challenges thats career throws at you</li>\n<li>[16.24] Diversity in the industry</li>\n<li>[25.18] Next Gen of Supply Chain, what you need to know</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Resources and links mentioned:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.crowley.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Crowley</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

Are you leaving money on the table? You might be, so what are you going to do about it. Some of your biggest savings lie within your nuisance expenses like uniform, waste disposal and pest control services and you may be like many other procurement departments that only review these expenses every few years. Rich Ham from Fine Tune is here to tell us why we should reconsider that strategy and how his company helps companies save money by optimizing those difficult-to-understand expenses.</p>\n<p>The current challenges of procurement professionals are that expense categories are segmented, some requiring much more management than others. This means that many business strategies leave money on the table, waste time and energy and don’t allocate resources adequately. With Fine Tune, companies can outsource all the complex, confusing expense management processes and focus on their core competencies and as Rich says “offloading headaches”.</p>\n<p>How does Fine Tune do this? They partner with the right people and focus on collaboration amoung all parties. This is very apparent when Rich shares with us a real life example of a client who had 14 different suppliers with several different contracts. Fine Tune helped that company reduce their suppliers to 4 through consolidation and that resulted in a huge cost savings of 35%. Rich goes on to say that their true speciality is removing friction from procurement and operations. The result? Companies invest in the Fine Tune management program because they don’t want to let go of Fine Tune!</p>\n<p><strong>In this episode we discuss:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>[0.30] Where are your biggest savings</li>\n<li>[5.56] Where are you leaving money on the table?</li>\n<li>[24.15] Reducing costs by 35%</li>\n<li>[28.07] Removing friction from procurement</li>\n<li>[35.58] The future is bright</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Resources and links mentioned:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.finetuneus.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fine Tune</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

That is the question on everybody’s mind as tech changes on a daily basis, In Sweetbridge’s <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210414103136/https://letstalksupplychain.com/season2-episode26/\">episode</a> in 2019 Scott said the knowledge base is changing every 1.5 years.</p>\n<p>Diane is the Vice President of Omnichain, a company that offers end to end supply chain solutions to companies looking to optimize workflow, manage different channels and orchestrate correct supply strategies. They are the partner for the future.</p>\n<p>Currently, many team members of companies need to manually add data into systems, losing information, accuracy and time.  This is because the supply chain industry is still very fragmented, with organisations struggling to connect and collaborate. Omnichain’s platform describes itself as a digital supply chain fit for the future, thanks to its better forecasting, operations system and proactive push model. Omnichain’s solution is what distinguishes it from its competitors; no need to download or integrate anything, everything can be done directly within the platform!</p>\n<p>Omnichain prides itself on using blockchain, a kind of distributed ledger and database that allows you to maintain and record all devices and transactions across a supply chain. Most people co-relate blockchain to crypto currency but that is not always the case. This technology allows you to hold information quickly and securely, which allows Omnichain to keep the entire supply chain management securely under a blockchain key. Omnichain’s ideal client is someone who faces the challenge of a fragmented operation and is looking for a better day to day workflow. Its solution encourages companies to go from a reactive management situation to proactive, allowing them to deliver real value from their data.</p>\n<p><strong>In this episode we discuss:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>[0.30] A Different approach to blockchain</li>\n<li>[9.39] What is a digital supply chain fit for the future</li>\n<li>[15.17] No integration needed!</li>\n<li>[19.40] blockchain is perfect for supply chain management</li>\n<li>[25.05] The future is bright</li>\n</ul>\n",

In the container world, things are still being done as they were 10 years ago. Terminal 49 aims to simplify global trade with much more efficient workflows.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/sea-2-ep-38-connecting-systems-for-full-visibility/\">Visibility</a> is a big challenge in supply chain: truckers, shipping companies and freight forwarders don’t communicate effectively and lack collaboration. Everyone’s solving a different problem, there’s a lack of education and cooperation is non-existent. This disconnect is what Terminal 49 aims to resolve.</p>\n<p>Akshay provides us with two excellent examples of a shipper and a broker. Before using Terminal 49’s dashboard, this shipper had several spreadsheets used for forecasting reports, ETAs and container management. When an incident happened, all information had to go through several different people in the chain. Now, with an all-in-one dashboard, the shipper can easily track every container and keep on top of demand. Oh, and all they need to do is import their spreadsheets onto the dashboard – no need to copy and paste thousands of numbers. Although the logistics world is a competitive space, Akshay says there’s a lot of room to innovate and create value, and that really, it’s still early days!</p>\n<p><strong>In this episode we discuss:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>[1.00] Terminal 49’s story</li>\n<li>[15.25] Why visibility is a challenge in supply chain</li>\n<li>[20.10] Successful examples of using Terminal 49’s dashboard</li>\n<li>[31.34] Advice for people who want to get into supply chain tech</li>\n<li>[33.59] The future of Terminal 49</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Resources and links mentioned:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.terminal49.com/about\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Terminal 49</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

That makes Elizabeth perfect for our <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/women-in-supply-chain/wisc-podcast/\">Women In Supply Chain™</a> feature on the podcast for the month of March because</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beth believes that this industry truly has the power to make the world a better place and that is why she has stayed working with ASCM for over 16 years.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight: 500;\">GLOBAL IS WHERE IS IT AT</h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is the future for supply chain media? Rennie believes that there’s a trend for high quality content that’s not focused on day to day tasks, but instead on more important global issues.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She’s contributed herself by working with Mr Supply Chain (Daniel Stanton) and his book titled Supply Chain Management for Dummies. Elizabeth is also very proud to have contributed in-depth interviews with successful <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/women-in-supply-chain/wisc-podcast/\">Women In Supply Chain™</a>, and believes these are great opportunities for women to learn from each other.</p>\n<h4>No longer the only Woman in the room</h4>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of diversity, Elizabeth is so excited to see that more and more women are joining the supply chain industry. Like at one point in her career she would look around the room at conferences and could maybe count the number of women in the room on one hand.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More organizations are working to increase diversity which in turn creates a healthy form of tension created by different points of view and more innovative conversations. So, Are you looking to get into supply chain? Her advice to the younger generation is to always be open to opportunities and taking risks, you never know where it can lead.</p>\n<h5><b><strong>IN THIS EPISODE WE DISCUSS:</strong></b><b><strong> </strong></b></h5>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[1.16] Falling in love with Supply Chain</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[4.30] Learning to become self aware</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[12.31] The future of supply chain media</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[18.02] The proudest moment in her career</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[21.52] No longer the only woman in the room</li>\n</ul>\n<h6><b><strong>RESOURCES AND LINKS MENTIONED:</strong></b></h6>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Management-Dummies-Business-Personal-Finance/dp/1119410193\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Supply Chain Management for Dummies</a></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.ascm.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ASCM</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

That’s a huge amount of money and waste in products that are being thrown out –  That’s the issue Spotsee is tackling with their product: indicators that track and record data such as temperature, tilt and impact throughout a shipment journey. There are a lot of challenges in this area that supply chain professionals are facing, Angela talks about the top realities companies are facing and how exactly <a href=\"https://spotsee.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Spotsee</a> can help you save time, money and waste.</p>\n<p>Spotsee allows companies to be proactive rather than reactive when it comes to damaged products. Instead of receiving damaged products, blaming the shipment company and filing an insurance claim, companies can now collaborate with the freight forwarders to determine why and how the damage happened and work on fixing the problem together, all based on data. These monitoring programs reduce damage to 40%, which can translate into tens of thousands of dollars saved for certain companies.</p>\n<p>Spotsee works with several market segments as well as SMEs that are looking to grow. By having real time data on product journeys, companies waste a lot less time, energy and money fixing these issues. In the long run, this is a much more sustainable business model which can give companies a huge competitive advantage. Spotsee are also big on company culture, find out more about how they are encouraging the next generation to come and work in supply chain. Their ambition? To aggregate all the data from every journey, product and company so their customers can take real actionable steps from large-scale data analysis.</p>\n<p><strong>In this episode we discuss:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>[0.25] Who is Spotsee</li>\n<li>[9.10] Damage is costing you Billions!</li>\n<li>[14.30] data on your products journey</li>\n<li>[18.36] Who can benefit?</li>\n<li>[23.50] encouraging careers in supply chain</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Resources and links mentioned:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://spotsee.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Spotsee</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

The founders were tired of the manual process of keeping track of rates through word documents, excel spreadsheets and decided to build a solution to help manage all the different rates from different carriers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/season2-episode24/\">What does all this technology mean for your business</a>? Virgil Ferreira, the CEO of Catapult joins us to talk about how their platform helps businesses see rates from different carriers including ocean, air and ground, giving logistics providers more visibility into their rates so they can increase their margins. A Challenge that logistics providers face is that they don’t have access to industry data but Catapult changes that as providers can also compare their own data with industry data and see it all in a standard, easy-to-use view. The biggest challenge logistics providers face is understanding how to get the best market rate. With Catapult, businesses can use the tool to see the gaps in their system and focus on improving profit, which all providers are looking to do!</p>\n<p>Their typical clients are mid to global sized forwarders with a large number of vendors and a large customer base. These are clients looking for technology enabled solutions and need help getting their rate management house in order. By using a rate management platform, logistics providers can apply margins where they want, map different features into an internal format and use this across different modes. As Virgil says, the main things companies should be focusing on in 2020 is understanding what the customer is expecting and encouraging interoperability across different structures.</p>\n<p><strong>In this episode we discuss:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>[1.47] Who is Catapult?</li>\n<li>[4.02] Freight Management is critical to success</li>\n<li>[8.12] The main challenges for logistics providers</li>\n<li>[15.08] Get your Freight Management house in order!</li>\n<li>[23.47] What you should focus on in 2020</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Resources and links mentioned:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://gocatapult.com/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Catapult</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

Suuchi helps companies diversify the supply chain by digitizing the entire process, because all brands must start thinking of supply chain as a strategic <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/the-time-is-now-for-retailers-to-future-proof-their-supply-chains-with-a-cohesive-approach-for-end-to-end-replenishment-planning/\">competitive advantage</a></p>\n<p>What sets them apart? Transparency. They’re able to track and trace every process in the supply chain, which allows them to provide their customers with truly data driven solutions.

Her attitude is: family first, career second and community third. She graduated in engineering, joined IBM, ran an entire supply chain, worked in GE Healthcare and is now working in supply chain for <a href=\"http://www.google.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a>. Her career has been a huge adventure, and today she shares some of the nuggets of wisdom she’s learned over the years.</p>\n<p>She’s had many challenges in her career as a female on a supply chain team, but it’s her positive attitude and openness to taking care of others that helped her get to where she is now. She’s really had to push for opportunities, and has seen the industry evolve over the 36 years that she’s been working in supply chain. Things are getting better, with now 25% of leadership positions held by women. Claudia works hard to educate leaders and encourage the right conversations about diversity and openness.</p>\n<p>What about supply chain? Claudia explains that companies aren’t using data as they should be. She says that it’s important to get the basics first, make sure to have the right KPIs in place and then analyze the big picture. Her advice to fellow supply chain leaders is to <strong>meet with customers on a regular basis</strong>. Understand the voice of the customer and don’t always think of optimizing a function but instead, the end to end journey. Her plans for the future are to keep on learning and growing, never wasting a day and keep pushing for diversity.</p>\n<p><strong>In this episode we discuss:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>[4.14] Claudia says, Live life to the fullest</li>\n<li>[13.14] What is Supply chain at Google</li>\n<li>[18.42] Claudia’s advice for younger self</li>\n<li>[26.55] Supply chain leaders, meet with customers!</li>\n<li>[30.34] Pushing for Diversity</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Resources and links mentioned:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Claudia on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/claudiaknowltonchike/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

Daniel is a top influencer in the global supply chain community: the author of Supply Chain for Dummies, publisher of 10 supply chain courses on LinkedIn Live and over 35,000 followers on LinkedIn!</p>\n<p>In our live we discuss top social media tips for professionals in the supply chain industry. Why care about social media? Social media is a great way to build a professional network. It’s also an amazing way to learn more about your industry, as well as share what you know yourself. And of course, if you do it well, it’s a lot of fun.</p>\n<p>When getting started with social media, it’s important to pick a platform where you feel the most comfortable. This could be Twitter for engaging conversations, or LinkedIn for B2B communication. Daniel emphasizes the importance of finding your tribe and building a network of like-minded individuals. Sarah shares some tips when it comes to engaging with others online, and Daniel tells us how we can encourage others to engage in conversations. The episode ends with an explanation from Daniel on <em>why </em>social media is a part of building and navigating your professional journey. At the end of the day you <strong>get out of it what you put into it.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>In this episode we discuss:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>[5.02] Why social media is important</li>\n<li>[6.37] How to choose platforms and find your tribe</li>\n<li>[18.54] Engaging with others on social media</li>\n<li>[31.54] How to curate content and find your voice</li>\n<li>[41.17] Using LinkedIn Learning and LinkedIn Live</li>\n<li>[49.29] Integrating social media in your career journey</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Resources and links mentioned:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Management-Dummies-Business-Personal-Finance/dp/1119410193/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=supply+chain+for+dummies&amp;qid=1579185716&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-3\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Supply Chain for Dummies</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/video/live/urn:li:ugcPost:6622940909975715840/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Linkedin Live Recording</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

They’re already connected to over 100,000 supply entities, 35,000 shippers across 177 countries and perform 8 billion transactions per year. In other words, they know what they’re doing when it comes to supply chain and they help to unleash business potential in every company they work with.</p>\n<p>Rebecca explains that companies in 2020 should focus on embedding technology and AI, and learn how to leverage real time channel data. Instead of just following the trends and buzzwords, companies should put an emphasis on understanding the best way to leverage technology, since it’s not a one size fits all solution. This means understanding what to do with data and how to use it appropriately.</p>\n<p>Another issue that will be affecting supply chains globally is Brexit. E2open offers a unique solution called “Brexit ready in one day” that prepares companies for the potential impacts of Brexit. What makes E2open different is their large network and the fact that they’ve been managing data for two decades.

Although she’d always worked in media and had a marketing degree, once she “drank the juice” she got hooked on the logistics industry, and has been working in supply chain sales ever since.</p>\n<p>As a woman in supply chain she’s grateful to society for enabling a social environment that boosted her career. She’s learnt how to earn respect, push her own limits and combine her passions (branding and marketing) into her career. Most of all, she’s worked on combining the right and left side of her brain, to foster more creativity when working on solutions for a changing demand.</p>\n<p>On top of dealing with a fast paced and demanding job, Holly is a single Mom and works remotely. But she’s managed to keep a balance and enjoys a successful personal life. How? She says by remembering her priorities, having a strong support network and doing some serious planning. She makes the time she has with her son extra special and makes sure to have a dedicated office for work to keep disciplined with her time. She is living proof that you can have a successful career and home life – just take it easy on yourself too!</p>\n<p><strong>In this episode we discuss:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>[0.31] Hooked on Supply Chain</li>\n<li>[5.03] Women in Sales</li>\n<li>[14.00] Why changing demand requires more creativity</li>\n<li>[17.26] Working as a single parent in supply chain</li>\n<li>[26.20] How she manages working remotely</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Stay Connected with the Podcast:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Find us at <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/\">Let’s Talk Supply Chain</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

Two supply chain professionals! Allison and George are a couple who met at a supply chain conference and both work in different areas of logistics. Allison mostly works on strategy and supply, whereas George works in the tactical planning of merging technology and software.</p>\n<p>As a family working in supply chain, Allison and George complement each others backgrounds and regularly work together to solve supply chain challenges. In fact, they have white boards around the house where they discuss any issues they’re facing. This extends to their children, who also get involved and are understanding the huge role logistics have in getting products to our door.</p>\n<p>Their advice to next generation supply chain professionals? Get deep technical expertise early on and don’t wait too long to switch into the supply chain industry. Start working with products, learn the technical aspects and build a repertoire of skills. As Sarah says herself, always keep your options open and try different departments to see where you fit best. Allison and George are both minorities in supply chain, and although diversity has improved, Allison admits that women need more support not just from leaders, but also from other women. She also recommends finding your own personal board of directors to challenge you and to be your cheerleaders.</p>\n<p><strong>In this episode we discuss:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>[0.36] Supply Chain conferences aren’t just for networking</li>\n<li>[19.30] Supply chain in the family</li>\n<li>[23.02] Advice to the next generation in supply chain</li>\n<li>[25.31] Women In Supply Chain™</li>\n<li>[29.25] Their plans for the future</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Resources and links mentioned:</strong><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Stay Connected with the Podcast:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Find us at <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/\">Let’s Talk Supply Chain</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

As horrendous as that sounds, it’s true. There are more slaves today than there have been in the whole of human history. That’s why Grant is passionate about contributing any help he can for operations that rescues and takes care of trafficked kids.</p>\n<p>Like a grocery supply chain, a human trafficking supply chain requires demand. Traffickers use fake orphanages that sell or rent children for many different reasons. The statistics are shocking: 36% of children are trafficked by family members, and human trafficking is a $150 billion industry. The only way to take control of this supply chain is to break it down and disrupt it.</p>\n<p>Grant talks about how he is getting involved with his new initiative &#8220;Freedom Rings&#8221; inspired by Tim Ballard&#8217;s &#8220;Operation Underground Railroad&#8221; an organization that goes undercover and “buys” children from fake orphanages to then let them free. Grant also shares how supply chain and slavery is connected going back into the 1800s with Henry Box Brown story that shows how it takes creativity and courage to rescue those that are trapped. Getting ready to launch officially in 2020, Grant&#8217;s own &#8220;Freedom Rings&#8221; organizes boxing events in Tennessee which helps raise awareness for human trafficking and helps fund human trafficking operations.

What makes them special? Their CCM pools work as an ‘open membership’ model that allow many different carriers access to chassis’ faster. You might be wondering what exactly that means for your supply chain and we will paint that picture in this episode but from a high level,  It means that if there aren’t any chassis available, the pool will find some and send some to the location that needs them the most!</p>\n<p>This unique model allows all stakeholders (ocean carriers, truckers, leasing companies) to all be under one management, which in turn reduces costs, delays and makes the industry generally more efficient. This also allows every stakeholder to be represented under one network, with CCM working as a neutral facilitator making sure that chassis go where they are needed. This means there’s a large reduction in fleet and maintenance programs are much easier to coordinate, which bring us to the most important benefit of them all – the environment and sustainability which we are hearing more and more about each day.</p>\n<p>There are many benefits to having everything under one management, one big one being sustainability. Usually, every line has their own chassis, this means that every operation takes longer – the driver needs to go find the chassis, the train is therefore delayed and is running longer. By sharing chassis in an interoperable pool there are fewer delays, a reduction in the volume of activity and more efficiency – this helps reduce the overall carbon footprint of the companies.</p>\n<p><strong>In this episode we discuss:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>[0.28] What exactly is CCM chassis pool</li>\n<li>[4.51] The challenges of current shippers</li>\n<li>[10.39] Who really needs this solution?</li>\n<li>[13.35] Visualize how chassis pools can help you</li>\n<li>[19.15] What does this mean for the environment</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Resources and links mentioned:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ccmpool.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CCM Pool</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.intermodalexpo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Intermodal Expo</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ocema.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ocema</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

Lisa went back to work in supply chain after 12 years out of the workforce taking care of her three boys. Thanks to her dedicated self-learning and determination, she was able to get the position she wanted in less than a year of looking for a new start.</p>\n<p>How? Imagine yourself as a case study, Lisa says. She regarded her situation as a template, analyzed the economy, did a lot of self-training and adopted an unstoppable mindset. She is proof that if you really want it you can make it happen. Your journey to success is not only about finding the right position but also the advancement of your career and negotiation is an important part of that so Lisa adopts a similar mindset when it comes to negotiation. Negotiation is about defining a problem and making sure both sides win. When it comes to negotiating, Lisa recommends looking at other opportunities rather than your salary, such as flexibility and in-company training.</p>\n<p>In her free time, Lisa helps other women get back into the workforce through talks, workshops and blog posts. Her main advice? Make sure not to put the onus on other people for your work to be recognized. Acknowledge your value and make sure your company is aware of it. Her advice to students: negotiate as high as you can on your first job, it could make a difference of literally millions in the future.</p>\n<p><strong>In this episode we discuss:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>[1.15] Lisa’s journey</li>\n<li>[9.49] The risks of going back into the workforce</li>\n<li>[12.29] How Lisa self-trained herself</li>\n<li>[15.06] The art of negotiation</li>\n<li>[22.40] Tips and advice to listener</li>\n<li>(29:10) there are 10,000 job opportunities in supply chain opening every day</li>\n</ul>\n",

Irina Rosca is here as guest host and she is back to interview an old friend, Graham from BorderBuddy! Graham and Irina chat about what’s happening to the retail industry, some interesting trends they are noticing and how Amazon is altering supply chain.</p>\n<p>One of the trends that Graham watches closely is bankruptcies like Forever 21, Doomsayers are saying that a combination of Amazon and a change in consumer habits means retailers are at high risk of closing down. Graham takes a look at bankruptcies to see how they are affecting the supply chain industry, it is hard for service providers to take a hit like that so we all have a responsibility to each other to do what we can to stay competitive. We’re living in a busy world, where time is of the essence, so if your product is not sold online, bye bye. Retailers are still catching up, which is difficult when Amazon owns every part of the supply chain process and offers same day delivery.</p>\n<p>But Graham isn’t so pessimistic. Although retailers are closing down, consumers are still buying. Sales aren’t changing, they are simply moving &#8211; people are buying products somewhere else. Retail is not for the faint of heart. Graham’s advice to retailers is to keep control of manufacturing and marketing. Start with your customer and work your way backwards, and make sure you control as much of your product as possible. At the end of the day, there are tons of people who benefit from store closures, and you could be one of them.</p>\n<p><strong>In this episode we discuss:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>[0.56] What’s happening to retail</li>\n<li>[3.02] Trends in the market</li>\n<li>[10.14] How to compete with Amazon</li>\n<li>[25.59] Why consumer habits are changing</li>\n<li>[34.14] Advice to retailers</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Resources and links mentioned:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://borderbuddy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Border Buddy</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://shop.lululemon.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lulu Lemon</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

They are changing the game for inland ports everywhere and upping the bar to where you will want to get to know them. Kleo Landucci, changemaker and Chief Commercial &amp; Corporate Affars officer of Ashcroft Terminal show us how they are a company that provides transportation logistics in a unique geographical position: it’s an inland port at a junction of the CP and CN rail lines in Western Canada.</p>\n<p>Kleo’s father had a vision to turn a specific piece of land into a container business in 1999, and Kleo joined in 2004 from the financial sector. The last 2 years have been very active for Ashcroft Terminal: they have taken on a Giant and turned it into a solid partnership and joint venture. They recently sold 60% of their company to PSA International, The largest Port operator that shipped 81 million containers in 2018 and will help establish Ashcroft as a big player in this space.</p>\n<p>Planning for 2020? Consider what an inland port can do for you and how it can positively impact your business. First of all, rail traffic is much more efficient than truck traffic, both in time and cost. Second of all, railroads could be part of Canada’s climate change solution. 300 trucks on the road equates to one train – this drastically decreases carbon emissions.Third of all, it’s very likely that future generations of supply chain will need to include railroads in their company strategies, listen to the full episode to find out more and why Ashcroft is uniquely positioned to offer many shippers the chance to ‘jump ship’ to railroads.</p>\n<p><strong>In this episode we discuss:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>[1.04] David vs Goliath, the story behind the partnership</li>\n<li>[4.38] The little inland port that could</li>\n<li>[13.46] Kleo’s touch</li>\n<li>[15.25] How inland ports impact supply chain</li>\n<li>[28.05] rail vs truck, consider the consequences</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Resources and links mentioned:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ashcroftterminal.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-schema-attribute=\"\">Ashcroft Terminal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ashcroftterminal.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-schema-attribute=\"\">PSA International</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

In today’s episode Sarah chats with Nicole Vernkidt who was originally on the show back in season 1. Nicole own theomx.com and is changing the face of procurement with her experience in both manufacturing and supply chain. Nicole grew up in a family business, and was exposed to a business environment from a very young age.</p>\n<p>As a young woman in business and a start up looking for investment, Nicole was faced with certain challenges such as dealing with a credibility gap and not being able to relate so much to older, male investors. But as she says herself, when you decide to do things differently and expose yourself to the business world, you’ll face challenges one way or another. She also admits that there have been some advantages to being a woman, and that at the end of the day the most important is that gut feeling that you’re doing what you know you’re meant to be doing.</p>\n<p>To all supply chain leaders, Nicole says <em>make sure to get involved ahead of time. </em>Supply chain now needs to be part of strategic decisions and needs to be there to be able to secure innovative resources and partners. This means understanding the most up to date technologies and being able to bring creativity to the forefront of decision making. Technology will always be a part of the solution, so make sure you prioritize learning the basics.</p>\n<p><strong>In this episode we discuss:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>[5.24] From manufacturing to procurement</li>\n<li>[15.12] Lets get out of our own way!</li>\n<li>[23.38] Give us the highlights</li>\n<li>[28.35] Just do it, but practice first</li>\n<li>[30.49] Pay attention leaders</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Resources and links mentioned:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://theomx.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://theomx.com/</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

What in particular do they focus on? Making your e-commerce return process smooth with reverse logistics.</p>\n<p>The main challenge when it comes to handling returns is driving friction out of the process – processing returns is costly, time-consuming and a negative experience quickly builds a bad reputation for the company. Using reverse logistics, Inmar manages the return process for the company, including inventory control, managing consumer credit and offering top customer service. Customers want different options when returning an item, and interconnecting every single aspect of the chain is the only way to provide a seamless experience.</p>\n<p>Inmar handles returns by offering clients their software, micro-warehousing services and leveraging their network. As a result, companies are saving millions, reducing waste and getting a chance to get closer to their customers through a process that helps them stand out from competitors.</p>\n<p><strong>In this episode we discuss:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>[3.04 What is reverse logistics</li>\n<li>[6.50] The challenges when handling returns</li>\n<li>[10.56] Managing consumer versus wholesale returns</li>\n<li>[17.23] The potential ROI of returns</li>\n<li>[23.09] Why Inmar?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Resources and links mentioned:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.inmar.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Inmar</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

At a recent conference, VC’s mentioned how RPA is the next frontier technology, so we are excited to get an opportunity to discuss what exactly is getting them so excited!</p>\n<p>What is the difference between RPA and AI? Matt puts it adequately: AI is a collection of different tech such as machine learning and OCR, and RPA is itself part of AI. How does RPA Labs implement this when helping businesses? They have 3 main applications: document, conversation and workflow. For example, instead of manually replying to customers and keying in data, RPA Labs offers intelligent bots that read messages and can answer simple customer queries.</p>\n<p>Their solution is pretty groundbreaking because contrary to other software providers, RPA Labs does not require signing into portals or hiring new developers. They call themselves ‘system agnostic’ and provide tech that sits on top of a company’s email or website. This means no more time wasted answering basic queries, keying in data or even categorizing emails from documents; RPA Labs can do it all for you. If you want to stay competitive in 2025, this is the kind of technology that will be an absolute necessity.</p>\n<p><strong>In this episode we discuss:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>[0.36] How Matt got involved with RPA Labs</li>\n<li>[9.16] The difference between RPA and AI</li>\n<li>[12.07] 3 main applications to move you into the future</li>\n<li>[17.52} Why VC’s are getting excited</li>\n<li>[24.01] Why portals are an outdated solution</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Resources and links mentioned:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.rpalabs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-schema-attribute=\"\">RPA Labs</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

They’ve been following a SAAS business model since 2002 and pride themselves on being highly flexible and delivering great customer value when it comes to technology.</p>\n<p>Niklas started Centiro for a simple reason: he couldn’t find what he wanted in the market. By founding his company, he was solving a problem for himself as well as the market. This worked out pretty well as Centiro is now operating in 125 countries and has over 300 employees. The reason? They look at things globally, not just in one country. When it comes to supply chain, everything is linked together, and Centiro is right at the heart of it, labeling themselves as a ‘connector’.</p>\n<p>Niklas argues that helping companies go digital has huge benefits. It alleviates pressure on IT departments and it’s much more cost effective on customer service. But cost efficiency alone is not a sustainable advantage – supply chain is. By focusing on efficient collaboration in supply chain, a company has a much higher chance of beating its competitors. And Centiro focuses on helping businesses do exactly that. Niklas and Centiro also has a unique view on their teams, they look at individuals whollistically and ensure all their passions come alive in their jobs.</p>\n<p><b>In this episode we discuss:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>[1.04] What Centiro does</li>\n<li>[8.51] Centiro’s business model</li>\n<li>[11.15] The benefits of digitizing business</li>\n<li>[20.31} Why supply chain offers a competitive advantage</li>\n<li>[39.31] Centiro’s talent acquisition and retention strategy</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Resources and links mentioned:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.centiro.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-schema-attribute=\"\">Centiro Solutions</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

Shyft is a mobile solution for hourly workers that finally allows shift workers to be in control of their schedule. Anyone working in warehouses knows that managers and employees waste a lot of time allocating shifts, finding replacements and organizing teams. Shyft puts all the updates and communication you need in one app.</p>\n<p>Lets put it into context, a typical shift worker no longer needs to physically enter the warehouse, find a manager, ask about their shift just to be told they are not needed,  A quick tap on their phone will allow them to be on top of their schedule, notify managers if something happens and communicate with other workers which to 95% of employees It’s pretty much a dream come true.</p>\n<p>The benefits of Shyft have snowballed into some pretty amazing perks: a lot more time and freedom for employees, higher employee retention, better communication and a chance to form a community. Another bonus: data. Companies track everything in the Shyft app, which allows them to notice patterns between users and highly optimize the supply chain process. The future of warehouse work is flexibility, and Shyft is right at the forefront!</p>\n<p><b>In this episode we discuss:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>[0.52] Top three workforce challenges Shyft helps overcome</li>\n<li>[5.39] Shift workers are important to supply chain</li>\n<li>[16.05] The challenges employers face with employee retention</li>\n<li>[23.32] What a 95% employee satisfaction rate means to your company</li>\n<li>[35.00] The future of shift work</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Resources and links mentioned:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.myshyft.com/?utm_medium=Podcast&amp;utm_source=Lets+talk+supply+chain&amp;utm_campaign=Workforce+engaged\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-schema-attribute=\"\">Shyft</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

With his experience in supply chain, Curt has some very interesting insights on the supply chain industry and company culture which he talks about in this episode.</p>\n<p>We all know majority of companies struggle with data and that it is a huge part of conversations in the industry today. Data is a challenge in itself, and Curt shows us how Open Sky Group helps companies manage their data effectively by understanding what they need and making sure they have the right data in the right field.</p>\n<p>Another thing Open Sky Group seems to have cracked: company culture. They’ve won some of the most prestigious awards in the industry, and they’re recognized as a leader in supply chain. Curt explains that the reason is simple: they care. They care about the company brand and reputation. They care about their employees. They’ve adopted the Agile Project Methodology and aim to do ‘more with less’. They pride themselves on being honest, transparent and open, even if their customers have no idea what they’re doing. Open Sky Group is living in 2030 while we’re still here in 2019!</p>\n<p>In this episode we discuss:</p>\n<p>[0.48] Open Sky Group’s core mission<br />\n[5.15] The role of data in supply chain<br />\n[11.29] What sets Open Sky Group apart and who you need on your team<br />\n[17.57] Using the agile method<br />\n[26.55] What the future looks like</p>\n<p>Resources and links mentioned:</p>\n<p>Open Sky Group</p>\n",

Ally is one of the few women working in the maritime industry and has been working in the maritime industry for over 10 years.</p>\n<p>Her main challenge has been working in an industry where women make up only 2%. The biggest issue? Understanding the importance of being herself, and not ‘acting like the guys’. She’s learnt how to show up as herself, with her own talents and without trying to please everyone. She’s also had the experience of working on a ship full of women (10 women out of 250 people is a lot!), and this encouraged her to push for more camaraderie and diversity in the workplace.</p>\n<p>Since then, Ally has founded Women Offshore, an organization for women in the maritime industry to come together and play a part in increasing diversity. She’s working hard on the education barrier, not only to empower women in the industry, but also to provide opportunities for women outside of the maritime world. Her mission is to get the word out and spread the knowledge and data effectively.</p>\n<p><b>In this episode we discuss:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>[2.31] The risks Ally took early on in her career</li>\n<li>[5.00] The challenges of being a woman in the maritime industry</li>\n<li>[9.50] The importance of driving diversity</li>\n<li>[13.48] How she’s working on the education barrier</li>\n<li>[16.56] How to get the next generation excited</li>\n</ul>\n<p>SPONSORED BY HULFT:</p>\n<p><strong>Why are we supporting a women in SC episode:</strong></p>\n<p>The supply chain industry is growing dynamically and yet, women still only fill 15% of top-level supply chain positions (<a href=\"https://www.awesomeleaders.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/AWESOME_Gartner_2017_Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-schema-attribute=\"\">Gartner report</a>) HULFT believes that gender equality and diversity is critical of an inclusive workforce – we’re committed to making a difference where we can.</p>\n<p><strong>About HULFT</strong></p>\n<p>HULFT provides a single global platform that allows IT to find, secure, transform and move information at scale.

Charles is a supply chain expert, leader and since he’s worked in the industry for over 34 years we thought who better to answer this hot topic brought to us by the listeners.</p>\n<p>You will hear from our listeners about their challenges in working in a collaborative environment with supply chain teams and Charles will share with us his insights and amazing stories of how we need to change the narrative to bring together collaboration. So where does one start with all this? Charles gives us some helpful tips and it all starts with the leadership. Good leadership behavior trickles down and will mirror a collective approach within the team. Make sure all employees understand what every department does, and the importance of every individual’s efforts. He gives us another nifty tip: get every department to focus on the impact they have on the customer, and the role that supply chain has in the business.</p>\n<p>From his experience working with great project managers, Charles tells us that it’s important that both departments and individuals find common ground.

All those pens, tote bags and stickers you hand out at trade shows? That is the industry we are talking about, promotional products. They are a core part of brand awareness and business today but what do you know about those your purchase and hand out?… If your company accidentally chooses a promotional goods supplier that does not meet regulations, hurts someone or has connections with slave labour, the impact on your brand can be devastating!</p>\n<p>How can you make sure you source your promotional products come from an ethical supplier? Meet QCA, an accreditor that offers a program certifying promotional goods companies to make sure they meet regulations, are environmentally friendly and keep your brand safe. QCA offers you an opportunity to be proactive with your brand and only connect with companies that are aligned with your mission and values.</p>\n<p>Tim gives us some tips when it comes to choosing a supplier; ask them if they have a documented compliance program, a code of conduct and whether they source from overseas. At the moment, fewer than 1% of promotional products companies are accredited. The process is thorough and demanding – but in return your brand is guaranteed to be protected!</p>\n<p><b>In this episode we discuss:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>[1.58] Why promotional goods creates the most impact to your brand</li>\n<li>[8.03] 3 things to ask your promotional products supplier</li>\n<li>[14.50] What are we working with?</li>\n<li>[21.00] How to get involved</li>\n<li>[27.53] less waste, Promotional products becoming more sustainable</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Resources and links mentioned:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.qcalliance.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">QCA</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

Like many others, Pauline stumbled into the supply chain industry by accident and decided to stay. But she did find it challenging to move up the ranks as a woman, and combined with stress, a lot of travelling and a young family she decided to leave the industry and found her own yoga studio along with her business partner.</p>\n<p>Pauline turned to yoga and meditation to work on her mental health and help her cope with her day job. This led to her founding a yoga studio which offered classes for those with very busy schedules. Her supply chain skills came in useful when managing her startup; she knew how to create something scalable, the importance of starting from the bottom and which systems she had to put in place for business success. Her startup is now thriving and now has grown to 10 yoga studios across Ontario.</p>\n<p>The supply chain industry needs a shift away from tradition. Pauline is now back in supply chain helping out other companies improve their culture and leadership strategies. She believes that there are a lot of roles in the supply chain that still need fulfilling, and she knows both companies and customers are hungry for an innovation shift. For this reason she believes that companies with more collaboration and innovation will be the ones who stand out and succeed in the next 5 years.</p>\n<p><b>In this episode we discuss:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>[1.20] Pauline’s journey in supply chain</li>\n<li>[7.25] Building a yoga studio startup</li>\n<li>[12.00] Returning to supply chain with a focus on mental health</li>\n<li>[15.14] Why the supply chain industry needs a shift</li>\n<li>[20.20] Decision fatigue</li>\n<li>[24.13]The main challenges for the industry</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Resources and links mentioned:</b></p>\n<p>Pauline on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/pauline-caballero-91a66425/?originalSubdomain=ca\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-schema-attribute=\"\">LinkedIn</a></p>\n",

Most times, the customer just wants to be heard and recognized, and thats where we get in trouble by coming up with excuses that doesnt solve the problem.</p>\n<p>We hear Graham’s take on crypto and Facebook’s new Libra coin, then he takes us on a journey around KPI’s. After reading Bernie Smith’s book. he has come to realize that KPI’s help people easily track their performance and link it to the overall company strategy.</p>\n<p>Lastly, because Audrey is a shipper and Graham a customs broker we could not let this match up end without discussing the impending trade wars, and why at the end of the day it’s the customer that ends up paying for extra tariffs. Complicated Canadian regulations also means a lack of innovation and competition, however Audrey and Graham agree that this allows a certain trust in the government that other countries do not have.</p>\n<p>In this episode we discuss:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[2.12] Why it’s important to ask for a raise</li>\n<li>[7.50] We should share more of our mistakes</li>\n<li>[16.10] Libra and the future of crypto</li>\n<li>[21.50] Taking KPIs to the next level</li>\n<li>[27.48] How the trade wars affect the customer</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Resources and links mentioned:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://borderbuddy.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://borderbuddy.com/\" data-schema-attribute=\"\" data-cke-saved->BorderBuddy</a></li>\n<li>Book: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/KPI-Checklists-Bernie-Smith/dp/1910047007/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=kpi+checklist&amp;qid=1563865985&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.amazon.com/KPI-Checklists-Bernie-Smith/dp/1910047007/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=kpi+checklist&amp;qid=1563865985&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1\" data-schema-attribute=\"\" data-cke-saved->KPI Checklists</a></li>\n<li>Book: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Best-Service-No-Liberate-Customers/dp/0470189088/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3ILVZWNN7J96K&amp;keywords=the+best+service+is+no+service&amp;qid=1563866006&amp;s=gateway&amp;sprefix=the+best+service+i%2Caps%2C366&amp;sr=8-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Best-Service-No-Liberate-Customers/dp/0470189088/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3ILVZWNN7J96K&amp;keywords=the+best+service+is+no+service&amp;qid=1563866006&amp;s=gateway&amp;sprefix=the+best+service+i%2Caps%2C366&amp;sr=8-1\" data-schema-attribute=\"\" data-cke-saved->The Best Service is No Service</a></li>\n<li>Episode: <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/season2-episode9/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/season2-episode9/\" data-schema-attribute=\"\" data-cke-saved->The Risks of Working with a Customs Broker with Graham Robin</a></li>\n<li>Stay Connected with the Podcast</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Find us at <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/\" data-schema-attribute=\"\" data-cke-saved->Let’s Talk Supply Chain</a></p>\n",

Coco Pallet’s vision is to ship 400 million pallets per year, and their plan is to build 5 factories by 2022 to help with that goal.</p>\n<p>Coco Pallet offers a lot of benefits to the different entities in the supply chain industry. The coconut pallets are single use and one way, and they follow compliance for export regulations. They are mostly used for dry products such as books. The coconuts are bought from farmiculture waste. Since the coconuts have no value for the farmers, the coconuts are extremely cheap to buy, which in turn makes coco pallets cheaper than the wooden alternative. Coco Pallet uses in house glue and their own tools to build the pallets, making them 100% biodegradable and therefore allowing farmers to use the pallets to improve soil quality.</p>\n<p>Coco Pallet is part of a circular economy; they solve several problems at once and leave no waste. Farmers are provided with an extra income, importers get to lower their CO2 consumption and don’t have to pay extra fees for wood, and best of all, fewer trees are cut down. In fact, Michiel says that every factory they build saves 500,000 trees per year. Their success has led them to build a large factory in the Philippines and they will be opening 4 to 5 more factories in Asia in the next few years. Their ethical and profitable business model means there is a huge opportunity for impact investment.</p>\n<p><b>In this episode we discuss:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>[2.00] How Michiel found a way to make pallets out of coconuts</li>\n<li>[8.33] The benefits of using coconut pallets</li>\n<li>[14.19] How Coco Pallet created a circular economy</li>\n<li>[19.35] What products can be shipped on Coco Pallet</li>\n<li>[29.58] Their future and how to get involved</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Resources and links mentioned:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cocopallet.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-schema-attribute=\"\">Coco Pallet</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

They each have many years of experience working in the intermodal industry.</p>\n<p>Both Tom and Noel agree that the major challenge of the supply chain industry is the increasing sophistication that comes with working with different industry partners and shipping lines. As disruption meets innovation, customer expectations are also changing, their demands shifting from brick and mortar to more demanding e-commerce. Customers expect supply chain companies to make delivery processes fast, reliable and safe, which means increasing the efficiency of all coordinated shipments. IANA helps find solutions by bringing together industry leaders and placing education initiatives for everyone working with these logistics.</p>\n<p>This fall is the IANA Expo event, a must-attend event for anyone working in the supply chain industry. It’s the largest gathering of supply chain leaders and stakeholders, including attendees such as Bill Strauss, Jeff Heller and companies such as Armstrong &amp; Associates and SeaIntelligence Consulting. This is a great networking opportunity with around 1,800 expected attendees, over 125 exhibitors and more than 8 hours of exhibit time. IANA Expo is especially valuable thanks to the education sessions included in the schedule. Discussions on the future of supply chain, finding streamlined solutions and answering the big questions will take place during those several days. For those interested in helping shape the industry they work for, IANA is an event you definitely need to mark on your calendar!</p>\n<p><b>In this episode we discuss:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The major challenges of the supply chain industry</li>\n<li>The importance of coordinating shipments across entities</li>\n<li>The IANA Expo event</li>\n<li>Why it is a must-attend event</li>\n<li>The key speakers and how you can make the most of it</li>\n<li>The benefits of being an Iana member</li>\n<li>What the future holds for Intermodal</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Resources and links mentioned:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.intermodalexpo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-schema-attribute=\"\">Iana Expo</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.nsf.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-schema-attribute=\"\">NSF International</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.intermodal.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-schema-attribute=\"\">Intermodal</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

Demo lives in Panama, a country that has been a logistics hub for over 500 years and is a ‘one size fits all’ solution for global supply chains.</p>\n<p>Panama is a unique logistics hub because of its logistics assets. It has the Panama canal, allowing ships from all over the world to gain access. Panama also has a world class port system with 4 ports being developed, essentially supporting both the Pacific and Atlantic ocean. Panama has the biggest free trade zone in the southern hemisphere and charges no tax on export or on sale. This means huge savings in time and cost for businesses doing trade in that area. As Demo says, the logistics are much more efficient; what would take several weeks in Miami, takes 4 days in Panama.</p>\n<p>Doing business in Panama has some great advantages, as the country serves up to 30 countries and manages complex markets consisting of over 600 million people. Although Demo works mostly with big companies, he explains that Panama also has opportunities for SMEs thanks to its free trade zone airport and higher flexibility. The Supply Chain Forum happening in August is an excellent place to meet people who have experience doing trade in Panama – from SMEs to large corporations, everyone is welcome!</p>\n<p><b>In this episode we discuss:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Demo’s journey in the supply chain industry</li>\n<li>The history of Panama as a logistics hub</li>\n<li>Panama’s logistics assets</li>\n<li>Panama’s free trade zone compared to Miami’s</li>\n<li>The kind of companies working in Panama</li>\n<li>Attending the Supply Chain Forum</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Resources and links mentioned:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Company website: <a href=\"http://lspty.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-schema-attribute=\"\">Logistics Services Panama</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

Kathy has worked in the supply chain and IT industry for 20 years and joined ALAN in 2010 when she took an interest in supply chain and emergency management, and started working on efficient coordination of logistics activities during disasters.</span></p>\n<p class=\"normal\"><span lang=\"UZ-CYR\">The logistics industry is instrumental to disaster relief – over 60% of spending goes into logistics. Making sure people have shelter, food and water is much more complicated than it seems. Logistics experts can provide their expertise and knowledge in order to do good, and this in turn can save a huge amount of money; Kathy uses an example where an NGO saved over a quarter of a million dollars just from 15 hours of work from a logistics expert.</span></p>\n<p class=\"normal\"><span lang=\"UZ-CYR\">The most inspiring part of Kathy’s journey has been the opportunity to see the good that companies do during disaster. Disasters are happening all the time, and although this is painful to experience, peoples’ desire to do good and be a part of something positive stands out. Anyone who works in the supply chain and logistics industry has a huge opportunity to save lives and make an impact, just by offering expertise. Kathy hopes to keep serving ALAN and provide better tools for businesses and NGOs to collaborate during disasters.</span></p>\n<p><strong>In this episode we discuss:</strong><strong> </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Kathy’s journey to success</li>\n<li>The American Logistics Aid Network</li>\n<li>Why the logistics industry is so instrumental to disaster relief</li>\n<li>Advice as a woman working in the supply chain industry</li>\n<li>How to get involved with disaster relief</li>\n<li>The most important piece of advice for the next generation</li>\n<li>What is next for Kathy and ALAN Aid</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Resources and links mentioned:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.alanaid.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-schema-attribute=\"\">American Logistics Aid Network (ALAN Aid)</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

Graham Robbins, Idea Generator and Founder of Border Buddy is back in this episode! Graham shares with us why Border Buddy decided to focus on API integrations and what it has meant for his business and his customers&#8217; business. They integrate directly with Shopify and Ebay and are being exposed to customers they never would have before. Their integration strategy is also providing their customers with the tools they need to import and export globally with trust and ease AND increase their business by making it easy to calculate final shipping costs.</p>\n<p>Graham says that changing your mindset to focus on what the customers want and need in this new economy and focusing on some technology upgrades can change your business dramatically and open up new revenue sources. Why do we mention BITA, Fedex, Pipedrive, Ebay, Shopify, Woo Commerce and Maersk? You will have to tune in and see.</p>\n<p>Need a reference guide or Supply Chain Dictionary?

I will be interviewing a few experts about Block Chain over the next few months so that we all can get a better handle on this technology and how we can use to help with efficiencies.</p>\n<p>I thought we would start the block chain discussions in one of the most talked about and complex supply chains so we can understand how can be used as a solution. In this episode, Mike Cohen from Greenstream takes through the block chain model they are creating for the Cannabis supply chain and how it could be the solution to the regulatory oversights we are concerned with the legalization date looming.</p>\n<p>Need a reference guide or Supply Chain Dictionary?

You may not realize it but the process and how you work with your customs broker can determine the level of risk you are exposed to.</p>\n<p>In this episode, Graham Robins from Border Buddy is back and we go through the risks that you are susceptible to and for most of you these are risks that you don&#8217;t even see coming. The changes in the industry have really changed the role of how your customs broker works for clients and how they work with the government which could mean the difference in costing you time and money. There are also things to consider that you could do internally to take control of the risks.</p>\n<p>Need a reference guide or Supply Chain Dictionary?

Sweetbridge, an award winning open source non profit project with contributors being a diverse group of global citizens.  Scott Nelson, CEO of Sweetbridge has an amazing perspective on the industry, did you know that the entire knowledge base is being reinvented every 1.5 years? and because of this rate of change coming so fast and choices plus cost are increasing everything stops or stay mediocre so what do we do?</p>\n<p>In this episode, Scott shares his insights on thoughts about supply chain being a game and what you should know to play.

You may think you are on point and have it handled but if the customer gets a broken product, delivery doesnt meet their expectations or they have one bad customer service experience you may lose them forever or worse yet they complain on social or to their friends.</p>\n<p>With Customer experience, there is a fine line between the cost to ship vs the cost to serve the customer. In this episode, Jonathan Briggs, Director of e-commerce fulfillment at DHL explains to us why we need to find the balance and quickly. Jonathan will take us into the depths of customer experience, challenges most online retailers are facing, the value of speed, where you should invest your time and money, the future of deliveries and how your company can increase delivery times and stay reliable.</p>\n",

Some 38 percent of the former and 5 percent of the latter do not even offer online quotes, while most of those that do merely log an online request for a quote, which has to be followed up by e-mail or a phone call, often a day or more later.</p>\n<p>So what happens when you have been so focused on your own internal innovation that when you look up to implement with the others in your supply chain, they are not even close to keeping up?</p>\n<p>In this episode, Graham Robins of Borderbuddy, my resident industry expert is back to debate this topic with me. We talk about the consequences of moving faster then your chain, we share some possible solutions and wonder if collaboration could be one of those answers and we share insights into what will happen to service providers if they don&#8217;t get with the times and up their game.</p>\n",

Tariffs are generally introduced as a means of restricting trade from particular countries or reducing the importation of specific types of goods and services.</p>\n<p>These days there are so many rules and regulations to moving products from country to country and with the US leading the most influential changes we have seen in a long time, many are scrambling to keep up.</p>\n<p>In this episode, Graham Robins CEO of Borderbuddy and my resident expert is back to talk about this game changing subject rocking industries and the business world right now (right Andy Polk &#8211; FDRA?). Graham talks to me about asking the question why, being intentional, some of the biggest mistakes you will make with your tariff database, what your responsibility is and what you can do today to get a handle on costs and compliance.</p>\n<h2>Questions I Ask:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>What is happening at Borderbuddy since we last spoke?
