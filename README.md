Hi Soniya,

Hope you are doing well.

Following up on our earlier discussions, I wanted to reiterate a few open dependencies that are still awaiting confirmation. These points have already been discussed; however, I haven’t received responses yet, and clarity on them is required to proceed further.

Please find the details below:

1. Homepage Banner Carousel
* The homepage will display a carousel with multiple banners, and these banners will be maintained by the client’s team.
* Could you please confirm the process they would like to follow for providing and managing the banner images and related content?
* If a process is not already defined on their end, please let me know and I can propose a few approaches for their review.

2. Media Links with Posts (Podcasts)
* Will Spotify, Apple Podcast, or other media links be added while creating posts by the client’s team?

3. Event Reminder Emails
* Do they already have an email service or automation system in place for event reminder emails?
* If yes, could they please share the integration details?
* If not, should the selection and integration of such a service be handled by me or by their team?

4. Forms (Fillout)
* There are a few forms required as part of the project. Could you please confirm:
  I. Will their team be creating and managing these forms?
  II. Or should I create and configure them as part of the development?

5. LinkedIn Integration Credentials
For LinkedIn integration, the following details will be required from their side:

* Client ID
* Client Secret
* Organization ID
* Refresh Token

6. WordPress Article Categorization & URL Mapping
* I noticed that some articles are not mapped to categories and can be accessed directly via their slug.

7. Women in Supply Chain Pages

I. [https://letstalksupplychain.com/women-in-supply-chain/](https://letstalksupplychain.com/women-in-supply-chain/)

* This page displays a few articles. Could you please confirm whether these articles are static or dynamically fetched?
* If dynamic, how are they currently being selected and displayed?

II. [https://letstalksupplychain.com/women-in-supply-chain/women-in-supply-chain-blog/](https://letstalksupplychain.com/women-in-supply-chain/women-in-supply-chain-blog/)

* This page contains all blogs under Women in Supply Chain and includes predefined filters.

For example:

* In the “All” section, the post “Manoela Peixoto Talks Sustainability and Leading with Empathy” appears. Category:. Tags:.
* Under the “Career Advice” filter, the post “Chelsey Reynolds on Atomic Habits and Jumping into Supply Chain” appears. Category:. Tags:.
* Under the “Leadership” filter, the post “Karen Betancourt talks moving up and taking others with you” appears. Category:. Tags:.

However, across these posts, the categories appear to be the same, and no clear pattern is identifiable using categories or tags for filtering. For instance, a “career” tag also appears under the “Leadership” filter.

Could their team please help clarify how these filters are currently implemented and whether the filtering logic is automated or manually managed? The above posts are examples; however, this issue appears across most posts on this page.

Internal Query

8. Category Page Behaviour

* Will there be a category listing page that fetches content category-wise?
* If yes, should this page include only articles, or should podcasts and other content types be excluded?
* Additionally, will these articles also be utilized by the GenAI layer?

Clarification on the above points will help unblock the next steps and ensure alignment. Please let me know if you’d like to discuss any of these over a quick call.

Best regards,
Mayank Sharma
