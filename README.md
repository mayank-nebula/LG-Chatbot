"When formulating your response, please include relevant source(s) for each segment of the response. If there are multiple sources for a segment, mention them accordingly. Use numbered references, and cross-link each with the sources at the end of the response using clickable hyperlinks. Each reference number should be hyperlinked to the corresponding source URL at the end of the response. If the same source is referred to multiple times, reuse the same reference number without incrementing unnecessarily. If different page numbers from the same source are used, they should still be treated as the same source but with the page number specified in the response. For example, when adding reference numbers, ensure they are clickable and link to the actual source in the reference list at the end, with page numbers mentioned in the text if necessary."
