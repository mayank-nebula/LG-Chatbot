The ingestion techniques for PPT, PPTX, DOC, DOCX, and PDF files are carefully tailored to handle the unique characteristics of each file type. For PPT and PPTX files, the system extracts slides as images and sends the entire image for summarization. This approach is necessary because it is often challenging to accurately understand and extract individual elements from a slide, given the complex layout and embedded content. For DOC, DOCX, and PDF files, OCR is performed using models like FlorenceRCR, TesseractSB, or GPT-4(O), where the entire image of a page is passed through the model to extract text. Additionally, tables within these documents are treated as images, extracted, and then summarized to capture the essential information. Images within the documents are also extracted using the unstructured library and subsequently summarized using models like OpenBMB, LLAVA-LLaMA, or GPT-4(O). These tailored techniques ensure that all relevant content, whether textual, tabular, or visual, is accurately ingested and summarized, providing a comprehensive and efficient data retrieval process for the RAG system.
