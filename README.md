Hi Eddie,

I can provide the .crt and .key files as requested and save them in the specified directory. However, it would be helpful to have a guide on how SSL termination works for the service, including the necessary commands to run after uploading a new certificate. This will allow us to handle certificate renewals annually without needing to request additional information each time.
