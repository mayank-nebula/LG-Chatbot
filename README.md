Thanks, Ambar. Let’s analyze this once we have access then.

Subject: RE: Category enhancements
 
Hi Manik,
 
I had a couple of discussions with Kamal and Ashwin & below are our thoughts:

At this stage, we have not yet had a chance to review the current metadata, schema, or document categorization that Al is working on also, we have not taken Category enhancement into our effort consideration in both the SOWs. So, while the enhancements could potentially be beneficial, we’ll need more clarity on what is currently in place and what changes are being proposed to assess any impact accurately.

Our main consideration is whether Al’s work will alter the structure of the data we plan to leverage, particularly metadata. If the structure remains consistent, we don’t foresee any major concerns.
From our internal discussions:
•	Upansh has confirmed that this won’t impact his work.
•	Kamal also confirmed minimal impact on his WordPress-related tasks.
•	Ashwin’s team might see some impact, depending on how the category enhancements evolve
 
We’ll be in a better position to comment once we have had a chance to review the data and understand Al’s enhancement plans in more detail.
 
Thanks,
Ambar

Hi Ambar,
 
This is not extra scope. Al is her existing partner who built the website for her on WordPress. She’s just checking if she gives this work to him, it won’t have any impact on ours (in terms of any duplicate work, etc.). We just need to share our thoughts.
 
Best,
Manik

+ @Ashwin Sanjeevan, @Smita Sahoo
 
Hi Manik, Will discuss with Ashwin and team on Monday, there might some follow ups which we'll share. 
 
But, I don't think we should include anything additional to whatever scope we have agreed by December end as we are already running behind due to GCP services and data access issues from Google and LTSC. 
 
Thanks,
Ambar

Hi Manik,
 
I might have Al look to do this project of category enhancements (below) alongside the Google project, would this duplicate any work on your side?
 
Podcast Series & Category Schema Enhancement Add-on Project Fixed Project  With the changes going on, this add-on project can transform your WordPress default categories archives page into a schema-rich, enhanced user experience that maximizes discoverability through a nice exploration of related content from categories & tags you've already put the hard work of associating!
 
Thanks for your help
To our success
Sarah
