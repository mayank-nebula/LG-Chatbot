Hi [Client Name],

This email is to explain the proposed (revamped) setup for the Event page and to confirm how you would like to proceed.

Current Setup

At the moment, the entire event registration and reminder process is handled manually by your team.

Proposed / Revamped Setup

The Event page will display:

Events that are currently live on your YouTube channel

Events that are upcoming on YouTube

For upcoming events:

Users will be able to register directly on the website

Registered users will receive an email reminder 15 minutes before the YouTube event starts

To handle registrations and reminder emails, we can proceed in one of the two ways below.

Option 1: Mailchimp (Automated – Recommended)

We will use Mailchimp Transactional Email (only for sending emails).

When a user registers:

Their details are saved on the website

No manual intervention is required

15 minutes before the event:

The website automatically sends the reminder email via Mailchimp

The email subject and HTML content are sent directly from the website

This means:

No Mailchimp audience/list is required

No campaigns or templates need to be created in Mailchimp

Mailchimp is used only to deliver the email

To proceed with this option, we will need:

Mailchimp Transactional (Mandrill) API key

Verified From email address

Approval to define:

Email subject

Email HTML content

Option 2: Fillout Forms (Manual Handling)

Users will register using a Fillout form

All registrations will be stored as form entries

Your team will:

Access the entries manually

Send reminder emails manually before the event

For this option, we need:

Approval to use Fillout forms

Confirmation that reminder emails will be handled manually by your team

Next Steps

Please confirm:

Which option you would like to proceed with (Mailchimp or Fillout)

If Mailchimp is selected, please share the required access and details

Once we have your confirmation, we will move ahead with the implementation.

Thanks,
