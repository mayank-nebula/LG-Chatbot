Hi Team,

I'll need each of your individual SharePoint IDs. To find your ID, please follow these steps:

Open the provided URL.
Right-click on the page and select "Inspect" to open the developer tools.
Go to the "Console" tab.
Reload the page.
You'll see a log labeled "Current User Info"â€”that's where you'll find your ID. Please share it with me.
