8. Ubuntu Configuration and Service Setup
Working in Ubuntu involved several key tasks essential for the deployment and management of the RAG system. One of the significant learnings was changing configuration files for MongoDB to optimize its performance and ensure secure connectivity with other components of the system. Additionally, creating service files for the FastAPI application was crucial to automate the startup process, allowing the application to run as a background service and ensuring its availability after system reboots. Setting up Ollama, which is a containerized model environment, required configuring the system to handle specific model deployments and manage them effectively. These tasks provided a deep understanding of system-level configurations and service management in Ubuntu, enhancing the stability and reliability of the RAG system.

9. Docker Image Creation and Transfer
Another valuable learning experience was creating a Docker image from an already used container, a process that involved capturing the container's current state and packaging it into a reusable image. This image could then be transferred to another environment, where it could be deployed and run, ensuring consistency across different setups. This technique is particularly useful for replicating specific configurations or environments without needing to recreate them from scratch. It also highlighted the importance of understanding Dockerâ€™s capabilities in container management and deployment, especially in scenarios where portability and consistency are critical.
