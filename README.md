    "web_content": "<p>Welcome to 2026—it’s a new year, ripe with tremendous disruption and opportunities that have been the hallmark of the 2020’s so far. Gender diversity is more important than ever for companies to navigate the latest sea changes and drive business success. Why? Businesses with women on their executive committees earn a return on equity almost 50% higher than those without. Organizations in the top 25% for gender diversity are 27% more likely to outperform the industry average in profitability.</p>\r\n<p>While women are rising in the ranks—up to 29% in the C-suite, up from 17% a decade earlier—men still hold 66% of management roles. And women still receive less advocacy and sponsorship, meaning fewer promotions and less representation at the top.</p>\r\n<p>But there’s good news, too: <a href=\"https://www.ismworld.org/supply-management-news-and-reports/news-publications/inside-supply-management-magazine/blog/2024/2024-093/womens-representation-in-supply-chain-survey-finds-mixed-results/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">recent reports</a> show that women now make up 40% of the supply chain workforce. At Let’s Talk Supply Chain, our Women In Supply Chain™ series aims to increase that number and expand mentorship, career growth, and advancement opportunities for women who are as qualified as their male counterparts.</p>\r\n<p>Our Let’s Talk Supply Chain <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/women-in-supply-chain/\">Women In Supply Chain™ program</a>, blog, and podcast series showcase the importance of greater gender representation. This month’s featured leader is an outspoken advocate for women entering the industry and advancing in their careers.</p>\r\n<p>We are honored to highlight <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/leigh-barnard-4b7a7415/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Leigh Barnard</a>, the Chief Operating Officer at Cooler Logistics. Leigh boasts 15 years of experience in leading operational growth strategies for supply chain organizations and building critical relationships with customers, shippers, and receivers. She has a Master&#8217;s in Library and Information Science from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and a Bachelor of Arts in Public Relations and Advertising from DePaul University.</p>\r\n<h4><span style=\"font-size: 1.7em;\">1. How did your supply chain journey start?</span></h4>\r\n<p>I never intended for logistics to be my career. I majored in PR and Advertising, but graduated at a time when there were fewer opportunities in those fields. After dozens of rejected applications, I realized I needed to shift gears. Load Delivered took a chance on me and brought me on in an entry operations role. It didn’t take long for me to realize that this fast-paced industry, which rewarded drive and celebrated innovation, was where I was meant to be. I transitioned from operations to account management, eventually working my way up to senior management, and now serve as the COO of Cooler Logistics. Every role has taught me more about myself and reinforced the fact that logistics is where I was always meant to be.</p>\r\n<h2>2. How have mentors played a role in your growth as a woman in supply chain?</h2>\r\n<p>I’ve learned a lot from so many people throughout my career, but I don’t have anyone I would label a mentor. That’s one of the reasons I was drawn to Let’s Talk Supply Chain’s Woman In Supply Chain series. This industry would benefit from creating and growing a mentor pipeline.</p>\r\n<h2>3. What’s your experience working in a male-dominated industry?</h2>\r\n<p>Working in a historically male-dominated industry has been an incredible experience. Knowing that your voice is underrepresented makes you more intentional about how you use it. When I’m at the table with leadership, I understand that I’m setting the tone and expectations for those who come after me. While that can be a lot of pressure, it’s a powerful opportunity to stand out.</p>\r\n<h2>4. When did you find your voice in your career?</h2>\r\n<p>Like many young professionals early in their careers, I thought the best way to be heard was to have an opinion about everything. I gave feedback, requested or not, on every process change, technology rollout, and policy adjustment. My manager at the time pulled me aside and told me I needed to do a better job of picking my battles. While that felt harsh initially, I took it to heart. I realized that being more strategic about when and how I used my voice significantly increased its impact and allowed me to influence real change within my departments.</p>\r\n<h2>5. What advice do you have for Women In Supply Chain™ and others looking to start a career in the industry?</h2>\r\n<p>Don’t give up your voice for the sake of likability. Women are taught from a very young age that likeability is king. We want to please our parents, get along with our friends, and be admired by our teachers. This ingrained need can, in some ways, be a strength—our high social and emotional intelligence helps us navigate high-stress situations with ease. But people-pleasing can quickly become a weakness if it leads you to silence your ideas and opinions to avoid confrontation. Be respectful, but make your voice heard. There are still people in this world who label an outspoken woman a hassle, but far more don’t, and they will have your back if you dare to speak up.</p>\r\n<h2>6. Who do you admire in and outside of the supply chain?</h2>\r\n<p>I really admire Melinda Gates. She’s a shining example of how wealth and philanthropy should go hand in hand, and how true success cannot be achieved without giving back to our communities. Gates’ philanthropic focus can and should be replicated across all industries. Her dedication to women’s health and education is incredibly inspiring.</p>\r\n<h2>7. What have you learned on your supply chain journey so far and what’s next?</h2>\r\n<p>I’ve learned that I want to be great at my job. I want the people I work with to know that I will show up every day and put in 100%. On the flip side, I know I won’t be happy working with people who don’t show up in the same way. The future holds more opportunities to gain experience as a leader, and I intend to seize them. A year from now, I hope I’ve pushed to hire more women at <a href=\"http://coolerlogistics.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Cooler Logistics</a>, spent time mentoring and coaching each of them, increased our philanthropic efforts by growing our <a href=\"https://www.coolerlogistics.com/about/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Cooler Cares initiative</a>, and spent more time learning about this massive industry and expanding my network.</p>\r\n<h2>8. What does this Women In Supply Chain™ feature mean to you?</h2>\r\n<p>It’s such an honor to be featured in the Woman in Supply Chain series. When I started at my first brokerage, I so desperately wanted a woman mentor to look up to and learn from, so it would be incredibly rewarding to be that person for someone else. The supply chain and logistics industry offers so many opportunities, and I believe that highlighting successful women in logistics will inspire more to enter the field.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>We hope our Women In Supply Chain™ blog series inspires readers to reimagine what’s possible, take action, and bring people from different backgrounds together for stronger and more meaningful collaboration.

This collaboration allowed both carriers to optimize network coverage, reduce operational costs, and improve service reliability.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, in </span><b>early 2025, the partnership officially dissolved</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, marking the end of a significant era in ocean freight. This decision was driven by:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Diverging Business Strategies</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Maersk has been shifting towards an integrated logistics model, focusing on end-to-end supply chain solutions, while MSC is doubling down on fleet expansion and independent operations.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Market Competition &amp; Regulatory Scrutiny</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Regulators and market forces have pushed carriers to rethink traditional alliances, prompting a move toward more flexible partnerships.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Operational Flexibility</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Both companies now have greater freedom to tailor their services without being bound by alliance restrictions.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><b>The Birth of the Gemini Cooperation: A New Powerhouse in Shipping</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to the 2M breakup, </span><b>Maersk has formed a new partnership with Hapag-Lloyd</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, creating </span><b>the Gemini Cooperation</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Unlike traditional vessel-sharing agreements, Gemini aims to build a </span><b>more customer-centric and efficient shipping network</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, with key benefits such as:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Improved Service Reliability</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> – Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd plan to offer enhanced schedule integrity, which has been a major concern for global shippers.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Streamlined Port Operations</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> – The new network focuses on optimizing port rotations and minimizing congestion.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Digitally Integrated Operations</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> – Both companies are investing heavily in </span><b>digital freight solutions</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, making cargo tracking and logistics management more seamless for customers.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This move signals a </span><b>more agile and independent future for Maersk</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, aligning with its goal to become a fully integrated logistics provider rather than just a shipping line.</span></p>\n<h3><b>The Ocean Alliance Extension: Strengthening an Existing Giant</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Maersk and MSC have parted ways, </span><b>other alliances are doubling down on their cooperation</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Here’s what to keep in mind:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>More Options, but More Complexity</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> – As carriers form new partnerships, shippers may need to renegotiate contracts and explore alternative routing options.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Potential Freight Rate Volatility</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> – The dissolution of the 2M Alliance could lead to short-term rate fluctuations as Maersk and MSC establish independent pricing models.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Stronger Focus on Service &amp; Technology</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> – The Gemini Cooperation and Ocean Alliance are prioritizing digitalization and efficiency, meaning supply chain managers should </span><b>leverage tech-driven logistics solutions</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Implications for Shippers</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These alliance shifts have several implications:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Contract Negotiations</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Trans-Pacific carriers are proposing contract rate increases of up to 25% for the 2025–26 period.

    "web_content": "<h1>Breaking the .XLSX Chains: Corporate Venture Supply Chain Software as the Potential Game-Changer</h1>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>From 2018 to 2022, a whopping $55 billion of venture capital poured into supply chain technology. This mammoth investment spawned 27 ‘Unicorn’ companies. Yet, despite the relentless digitalization hype since the mid-2010s, the stronghold of Microsoft Excel remains unbroken. For around the 30th consecutive year, Excel reigns as the most-used Supply Chain Management tool. Multinational Corporations (MNCs) continue to rely on hefty .xlsx files to operate substantial segments of their supply chains. So, what became of this enormous capital injection? Where are the refined solutions that we were promised?</p>\n<p>In the sphere of supply chain technology, particularly in LogTech, an ill-guided narrative emerged. This tale suggested that logistics service providers were severely outdated, and lacking in digitization and transparency. This provocative storyline attracted substantial funding, unfortunately often directed towards founder groups with scant logistics understanding. However, this narrative is fundamentally flawed.</p>\n<p>Logistics service providers have consistently innovated, adapted, and remained at the forefront. They were never the problem. The real issue lies with the MNCs splurging millions on ERP projects, striving to shoehorn their unique supply chain configurations into an outdated, standardized tech set-up hailing from the 90s.</p>\n<p>Trying to fit a dynamic, highly-customized supply chain into a one-size-fits-all tech mold is as futile as trying to squeeze a square peg into a round hole. It’s doomed to fail. The fallout from this mismatch is often thrown at logistics service providers to resolve, leading to disjointed processes managed by trusty .xlsx files.</p>\n<p>So, where do we go from here? Is there a viable solution?</p>\n<p>Yes, and it revolves around acknowledging that supply chain management is far from monolithic. What benefits one corporation may harm another, and what proves effective for one business unit could be detrimental to another. Technology needs to respect this diversity. The venture capital funding should be redirected towards developing adaptable, customizable solutions tailored to cater to a corporation’s specific needs, rather than merely aiming for rapid, unsustainable revenue generation at high churn rates.</p>\n<p>As we chart our course forward, we must understand that digitalization isn’t just a buzzword, but a path toward crafting more efficient, resilient, and customized supply chain solutions. In this context, Corporate Venturing emerges as a potential game-changer. Grounded in real-life experience, solving real-world problems: this approach of devising solutions to everyday challenges has given birth to some exciting products. Examples are no-code tailoring SCM platforms unifying scattered Supply Chain ecosystems, allowing for the customization of supply chain software without draining IT resources.</p>\n<p>By championing solutions developed from hands-on experience and tailored to real-life scenarios, Corporate Venture Supply Chain Software companies can potentially break the chains of .xlsx, leading the way toward a more adaptable, effective, and digitized future for supply chain management.</p>\n<h4>Want to learn more?</h4>\n<p>➡️<a href=\"https://www.logward.com/post/blogpost-digitizing-supply-chains-in-real-life-what-works-and-what-doesnt\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">  https://www.logward.com/post/blogpost-digitizing-supply-chains-in-real-life-what-works-and-what-doesnt</a></p>\n<p>➡️ <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6977505206896885760/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6977505206896885760/ </a></p>\n<p>➡️ <a href=\"https://www.logward.com/post/why-your-digitization-campaign-will-fail\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.logward.com/post/why-your-digitization-campaign-will-fail </a></p>\n<p>➡️ <a href=\"https://www.logward.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.logward.com/</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/episode-343-create-a-one-stop-solution-for-supply-chain-automation-with-logward/\">Watch the podcast episode where we take a full dive with Logward.

    "web_content": "<h1>The Top 5 Challenges for Trucking Companies Providing Container Drayage</h1>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Container drayage refers to the transportation of shipping containers by truck between ports, rail yards, and distribution centers. It requires specialized equipment, such as container chassis and heavy-duty trucks, as well as trained drivers who are familiar with the local traffic patterns and regulations.</p>\n<p>Container drayage plays a critical role in the transportation of goods, but it also poses significant challenges for trucking companies. In this blog post, we will explore the top 5 challenges trucking companies face when providing container drayage services.</p>\n<p>1. Dead Runs One of the most significant challenges that trucking companies face when providing container drayage services is dead runs. A dead run is when a trucker has to travel a long distance to pick up or drop off a container but does not have any cargo to transport on the return journey. Dead runs not only waste time and fuel but also reduce profitability for trucking companies.</p>\n<p>Truckers may experience long waiting times at ports or depots when picking up or dropping off containers. They may also encounter situations where they are told to wait for hours, only to be informed that there is no container to pick up or no space to drop off the container. These situations can significantly impact the trucker&#8217;s productivity, leading to longer turnaround times and reduced profitability for the trucking company.</p>\n<p>2. Waiting for Carriers to Release Empty Containers Another significant challenge that trucking companies face is waiting for carriers to release empty containers. Trucking companies have to make a request for an empty container release via email, phone, or fax to the shipping line. The staff at the shipping line then checks their system and responds back to the trucking company with information on where to pick up the empty container.</p>\n<p>This manual process can take an average of 2.5 hours for truckers to receive an empty container release, resulting in delays and inefficiencies in the overall transportation process.</p>\n<p>3. Limited Ability to Choose Pickup Locations Trucking companies often have limited ability to choose pickup locations for containers. When the shipping line provides an empty container release, they inform the trucking company which depot to pick up the container from. The trucking company rarely has a choice in this matter and may have to travel long distances to reach the designated depot.</p>\n<p>There are usually multiple container depots across the city, with varying distances from each other. The lack of choice in selecting the optimal pickup location depending on the trucker&#8217;s schedule for the day can result in delays and increased transportation costs for trucking companies.</p>\n<p>4. Multiple Systems for Bookings and Empty Containers Another significant challenge that trucking companies face is the use of multiple systems to manage bookings and empty containers. With multiple shipping lines, trucking companies have to log in to various systems to input and access information, leading to disorganization and confusion.</p>\n<p>This challenge can result in data discrepancies and manual errors, leading to additional time spent reconciling and updating records across multiple systems.</p>\n<p>5. Limited Time for Drop-offs Trucking companies face a small window of time between early return dates and cut-offs, making it challenging to drop off containers in a timely manner. A missed cut-off can result in additional charges, negatively impacting the profitability of the trucking company.</p>\n<h3>Trakking Helps Solve these 5 Challenges</h3>\n<p>The process of sourcing and managing empty shipping line containers has long been a significant inefficiency for all industries that rely on importing and exporting goods. That&#8217;s why Trakking was launched in 2020 &#8211; a revolutionary digital platform that solves this problem by streamlining the process of requesting, managing, and returning empty containers.</p>\n<p>Trakking semi-automates the process of requesting empty containers, with 95% of requests being automatically approved within 15 seconds. Trucking companies using Trakking can see real-time data on empty container inventories at various off-docks and ports, enabling them to choose the best location for pick-up and return, thus reducing unnecessary trips and optimizing operations.</p>\n<p>The real-time data on Trakking drastically reduces dead runs for truckers &#8211; in fact, in the 10,000 transactions processed so far, there have only been 2 dead runs. Trakking&#8217;s single platform also makes it easy and efficient for trucking companies to manage all empty container returns and releases, as well as street turns.</p>\n<p>Trakking is a game-changer for supply chain efficiency, offering a centralized and automated solution that saves time, money, and resources for all parties involved in global trade. With Trakking, the frustration of inefficient container management is a thing of the past.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/episode-314-breaking-through-business-borders-broaden-your-reach-with-lean-solutions-group\">Watch the podcast episode where we discuss maximizing container efficiency with Trakking.

    "web_content": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last-mile delivery is complex. It’s a challenge that shippers and carriers worldwide are battling every day. Will my deliveries reach my customers on time? How do I know which route is the shortest and the fastest for my deliveries? How do I manage my fleet? How can I keep track of all my deliveries? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The solution to all these queries and various other challenges associated with last-mile delivery is quite straightforward: make a strategic investment in a robust last-mile delivery technology solution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the million-dollar question is how do you take the next step? How do you buy a last-mile delivery technology that best fits your needs and requirements? It&#8217;s a pressing concern that weighs heavily on the minds of many industry leaders.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Buy vs Build</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before companies dive into implementing last-mile delivery technology for their business, they must carefully consider whether building their own or purchasing existing technology makes the most sense. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shippers and carriers can choose to build a last-mile delivery technology if they have the financial resources and technical expertise to do so. Creating something from the ground up also needs time. Additionally, the process does not end once the in-house last-mile delivery technology is implemented. The IT teams responsible for these systems must ensure that they are regularly updated and maintained. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For many companies, however, building software is not part of their core competencies, and existing solutions in the market make more financial and operational sense. Purchasing last-mile technology nearly always guarantees faster deployment times and reduced capital expenditure. Further, companies that specialize in last-mile technology development are more likely to customize solutions and adapt to changing technologies more quickly</span></p>\n<h2><b>Key Considerations for Choosing the Right Last-Mile Delivery Technology</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once shippers and carriers decide that they want to invest in buying a last-mile delivery technology, they must consider the following factors before making their selection:</span></p>\n<p><b>Scalability:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The last-mile delivery technology must be flexible enough to adjust to the business needs of the shippers and carriers. An adaptive last-mile delivery technology will ensure that companies can not only smoothly handle their current volume of deliveries but also easily scale up when there’s an increase in delivery volumes. </span></p>\n<p><b>Integration capabilities:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Can your last-mile delivery technology effortlessly sync up with your existing systems? Consider how well the last-mile delivery technology can integrate with your existing systems, such as order management, inventory management, and customer relationship management (CRM) platforms. Seamless integration can streamline operations and is the key to improved efficiency.</span></p>\n<p><b>Customization options:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Evaluate whether the technology can be configured according to your business goals and specific requirements. For example, as a shipper, you may need a white-label last-mile delivery service. Or maybe you need tech that is specifically built for efficient big &amp; bulky last-mile deliveries.</span></p>\n<p><b>Real-time tracking and visibility:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Tracking and visibility are one of the most important components of any last-mile delivery technology. Look for features like the ability to monitor driver locations, estimated arrival times, and notifications for customers. Such features enhance transparency and improve customer satisfaction. They help shippers and carriers in identifying gaps in deliveries and taking proactive measures to fill them. </span></p>\n<p><b>Route optimization and planning:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Check if the technology offers advanced algorithms for route optimization and planning. Efficient routing can help reduce delivery time, and fuel costs, and improve overall productivity.</span></p>\n<p><b>Driver management tools:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Consider whether the technology provides tools for managing and optimizing driver assignments, scheduling, and performance tracking. These features can help streamline driver operations and improve productivity.</span></p>\n<p><b>Analytics and reporting:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Last-mile delivery technology must act as a repository of all the data involved in making deliveries. It should have in-built analytics and reporting capabilities. It should provide insights into delivery performance, metrics, and trends. This data can help identify areas for improvement and inform strategic decision-making.</span></p>\n<p><b>Customer support and training:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Customer support is critical when buying a last-mile delivery technology. The technology providers must provide adequate support to set up the system and once this has been done, they must resolve any technical issues that happen. Shippers and carriers should make sure their staff receives thorough training to handle future challenges effectively.</span></p>\n<p><b>Cost and ROI:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> When selecting a last-mile delivery technology, companies must carefully assess the associated costs. These expenses typically are upfront payments, subscription fees, and potentially renewal charges as well. Shippers and carriers must calculate the potential return on investment (ROI) of the technology. </span></p>\n<p><b>Future-proofing:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Technologies get outdated and quickly become obsolete. When investing in any last-mile delivery technology assess the technology provider&#8217;s commitment towards regular updates and innovation. An up-to-date last-mile delivery technology is the first step towards greater efficiency, seamless operations, and enhanced consumer experience.</span></p>\n<h2><b>In Conclusion</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last-mile delivery market is brimming with technology that can help improve delivery operations. Shippers and carriers need to comprehensively evaluate the most suitable last-mile delivery technology to enhance their operations and meet their customers&#8217; expectations.</span></p>\n<h3>Resources:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://fareye.com/buyers-guide?utm_content=229002418\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buyer&#8217;s Guide: How to Buy Last-mile Delivery Technology</span></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://fareye.com/resources/blogs/what-is-shipping-process\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Ultimate Guide on Shipping Process</span></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://fareye.com/resources/reports-guides/eye-on-last-mile-logistics\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Report: Eye on last-mile for logistics</span></a></p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/episode-314-breaking-through-business-borders-broaden-your-reach-with-lean-solutions-group\">Watch the podcast episode where we discuss the Last Minute Last Mile with FarEye.

    "web_content": "<h1>10 Steps Trade Show &amp; Event Managers Can Take to Save Money and Improve the Logistics of Their Next Event</h1>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The logistics of trade show assets can make or break an event. A small error in the planning or execution of a trade show shipment can increase the cost of exhibiting or result in exhibit materials missing from the show- jeopardizing a company’s investment. For event planners looking to improve their processes and reduce the cost of attending large events this year, logistics is an important variable to review. Awareness, preparation, and careful management of shipment timing can help save money and protect a company’s trade show investment.</p>\n<h3>The team at EFW Tradeshow has compiled a list of 10 action items for event managers to improve the logistics of their next event.</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1. Review your company’s entire show schedule and proactively plan. The logistics required to attend back-to-back shows can be cost-prohibitive if not considered well in advance. A plan that includes shipment planning, short-term storage solutions, temporary warehousing, and caravans can help save money.</p>\n<p>2. Be aware of the deadlines listed in the event manual. Pay attention to the deadlines listed in the event manual, including timelines for shipping to the advance warehouse or show site, targeted move-in/out, and forced dates and times. Surcharges for missed deadlines can increase exhibitor fees and lead to timeline issues with delivery and booth installation.</p>\n<p>3. Understand how drayage fees are calculated. Drayage, or material handling, is the roundtrip charge exhibitors pay to transport freight from the back of the carrier’s truck to the event space, and the return trip after the show is complete. Drayage can be charged as a flat fee, on a price per pound, or per hundred pounds basis. It is important to understand how your show calculates drayage and to follow the guidelines. This cost can account for a significant percentage of an exhibitor’s show budget.</p>\n<p>4. Package freight carefully and appropriately. Use crates, pallets, bubble wrap and foam padding to protect your exhibit assets during transit. Additionally- make sure your carrier knows they are loading the truck for a trade show delivery. Special handling fees for shipments that require additional time, labor, and equipment to unload, as defined in the show kit, will increase the cost of drayage.</p>\n<p>5. Label each shipment piece and remove old labels. Information such as company name, booth number, and number of packages on each piece increases the chance that your shipment will arrive on time. Without this information, pieces could get lost.</p>\n<p>6. Weigh and dimensionalize your freight before shipping to reduce billing errors. The weight listed on your Bill of Lading (BOL) should be completed accurately. This is often used by the event to determine drayage costs or provide you support if the drayage costs are inaccurate.</p>\n<p>7. Ask your carrier about wait time. Venue marshaling yards and wait times can cost you money. Carriers can wait in a marshaling yard for hours before being called to the dock for delivery or pick up. Check with your carrier to see how they are calculating wait time costs to ensure you don’t get hit with surprise charges.</p>\n<p>8. Complete and submit your material handling agreement (MHA) at the end of the show to reduce forced freight charges. The MHA informs the General Service Contractor (GSC) that your materials are ready for transit, and without it, the GSC will not release the freight to your carrier and may “force” your shipment by sending your materials back to the advance warehouse or the next destination using their carrier of choice. Submit this document on time and send a picture to your carrier.</p>\n<p>9. Review your insurance policy and understand your existing coverage. Too often, exhibitors assume that their assets are covered under the company’s corporate policy. However, many policies limit protections or don’t protect all property in transit or when it is temporarily away from the business location. Consider additional coverage options to protect yourself from unanticipated expenses.</p>\n<p>10. Consider a transportation partner that specializes in trade show shipping. Carriers with experience in handling exhibit materials safely and delivering them to event venues have the specialized equipment and infrastructure in place to get your materials there on time and in one piece. Add-ons like proactive planning, short-term storage, and on-site support can save time and money. The EFW Tradeshow team is devoted exclusively to special event transportation and logistics support. For more than 20 years, we have been helping companies improve efficiencies and reduce transportation costs. Contact our team to see if we can help support the logistics of your next event shipment.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/episode-289-achieve-control-capacity-care/\">Watch the podcast episode where we take a full dive with EFW.

However, due to the current crop of challenges, more of them are being asked to focus their attention on activities such as minimizing the amount of money tied up in inventory as well as the money held up in other parts of the organization.</p>\n<p>This has resulted in a shift of mindset — thinking of the supply chain not as a construct made up of disparate parts, but as something more holistic where every process has to work in concert to achieve a common goal.</p>\n<p>Within order management, for example, incorrect or incomplete orders slow down order entry cycle time and on-time deliveries which, in turn, impacts cash collection and cashflow.

    "web_content": "<h1><strong>Logistics Complexity and the Strategic Moves Companies Are Making to Reduce It</strong></h1>\n<p>The last mile is typically the costliest and most complicated leg of a supply chain, accounting for, on average, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/last-mile-delivery-shipping-explained\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">53% of overall shipping costs</a>. Last-mile delivery has become the center of attention for shippers and carriers in recent years as strong e-commerce growth has increased demand for home delivery.</p>\n<p>Stuck with legacy last-mile practices, logistics companies have struggled to meet consumer demand, which has compelled courier, express, and parcel (CEP) companies to rethink their last-mile delivery operations and how technology can play a role.</p>\n<p>Enterprises have started looking at technological innovations to simplify the last mile, investing in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) to automate processes such as scheduling and routing, improving supply chain visibility and reducing costs overall.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning’s Impact on Logistics Complexity</strong></h2>\n<p>Logistics companies are leaving no stone unturned in modernizing and streamlining their last-mile delivery operations. Recently, United Parcel Services (UPS) in collaboration with Google analyzed Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) data and used it to plan the most efficient routes for more than 25 million packages it delivers globally each day.</p>\n<p>Radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology helps logistics companies increase visibility into their last-mile operations. Visibility in the delivery process gives logistics companies more control over their last-mile operations.</p>\n<p>FedEx Dataworks, an organization embedded within the courier giant FedEx, harnesses the power of data science and ML to improve supply chain visibility. Dataworks uses AI to predict shipping times and accurate delivery dates.</p>\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://www.getfareye.com/insights/blog/the-last-mile-mandate-survey\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Last Mile Mandate survey</a> conducted by FarEye in 2022, U.S. consumers claim the ability to have delivery tracking as a top factor for creating a positive delivery experience. Logistics companies must invest in technologies that provide more visibility to not only their dispatch managers but to end consumers as well.</p>\n<p>Intelligent computer vision, an offshoot of AI, helps CEP companies automate repetitive tasks, handle massive shipments with ease and considerably reduce last-mile delivery complexities. Royal Mail recently opened Super Hub, with the latest scanning, sorting, and tracking technology. The hub is set to process close to 800,000 parcels per day.</p>\n<p>Postal companies like Swiss Post benefited from Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs), upping their parcel handling capacity to 40,000 parcels a day. Automation in the CEP industry is not restricted to warehouses and sorting centers. InPost, a parcel locker technology company, saw its profits rise by 67% thanks to investments made in deploying automated parcel machines (APMs).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Rise of Drone Technology</strong></h2>\n<p>CEP companies are also embracing drone technology to help deliver packages quickly and efficiently across multiple locations. Skyports Drone Services, a UK-based division of an advanced air mobility company, has been selected by Royal Mail to manage aerial distribution routes linking Scotland&#8217;s Orkney islands. The drone service provider aims to enhance the efficiency and reliability of drone deliveries for Royal Mail, demonstrating the growing integration of unmanned aerial vehicles in the logistics industry.</p>\n<p>The CEP industry’s future is being reshaped by new-age technologies like AI, ML, robotics, big data analytics, cloud computing, and predictive analytics. Investments in tech are being made to make last-mile logistics simpler, more cost-efficient, and more customer-focused.</p>\n<h2><strong>Reducing Logistics Complexity and Delivering Superior Consumer Experiences</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/metals-and-mining/our-insights/succeeding-in-the-ai-supply-chain-revolution\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">McKinsey</a>, successfully implementing AI-enabled supply-chain management has enabled early adopters to improve logistics costs by 15 percent, inventory levels by 35%, and service levels by 65%, compared with slower-moving competitors.</p>\n<p>The answer is clear: if companies want to simplify the most complicated aspects of delivery logistics, especially in the last mile, they must optimize their end-to-end omnichannel fulfillment with precision while minimizing last-mile costs.</p>\n<p>And to do so, they must pivot to modern technologies to reduce logistics complexity in their last mile operations with the end goal of delivering a superior consumer experience.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/episode-314-breaking-through-business-borders-broaden-your-reach-with-lean-solutions-group\">Watch the podcast episode where we discuss the Last Minute Last Mile with FarEye.

    "web_content": "<h1>Fulfillment Plus Value Added Services: A Magic Formula</h1>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Renewal Logistics handles warehousing and distribution as most 3PLs do, but where we are very different is that <strong>we are the ONLY 3PL that I know of in the US that also does Value Added Services projects at scale. And when I say Only, I mean Only.</strong> I was at an <a href=\"https://iwla.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">International Warehousing and Logistics Association</a> function a few weeks ago, and we were the ONLY company out of about 150 in the room that did Value Added Services as a primary function of our business. As it turns out the combination of fulfillment and value-added services in a single-sourced provider is a magic formula for success.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">What Are Value-Added Services?</h2>\n<p>Any Projects Or Programs That Are Needed To Prepare A Product To Ship.</p>\n<p>This Includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.renewallogistics.com/amazon-fba-prep-services/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon FBA Prep</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.renewallogistics.com/ecommerce-and-retail-fulfillment/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Wholesale Distribution prep</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.renewallogistics.com/apparel-services/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kitting</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.renewallogistics.com/services/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Product Auditing for E-commerce Fulfillment</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.renewallogistics.com/subscription-box-fulfillment/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Subscription box assembly</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.renewallogistics.com/logistic-services/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">End cap display assembly</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.renewallogistics.com/mold-remediation-services/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Cleaning or remediation services</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.renewallogistics.com/returns-and-circularity-services/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Returns</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Why Are Value-Added Services Important To Brands Choosing A 3PL?</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Client Story</h3>\n<p>I had a client recently who came to us and said that they had a product that was at a particular 3PL warehouse that had a promo insert that was in violation of Amazon’s policies, so they needed to remove these promo inserts from all of their products that were intended for Amazon FBA.</p>\n<p>They could never get the warehouse where these goods were stored, to get them to agree to handle this project, and they ultimately never were able to get the project complete at the warehouse. After months of trying, they ended up having to open a temporary space, have all the product shipped to them, they had to manually remove the inserts, and then had to ship the product back to the warehouse.</p>\n<p>What a hassle and what an expense!! Not only the shipping and transfer expense of moving the product, but the lost time of the managers who had to stop working on things to grow the business, who had to divert their time to managing this project, and then also think about the lost sales.</p>\n<p>On the flip side, what we offer to companies is the ability to harness the potential of each and every product.</p>\n<p>The most successful brands in the world are watching their inventory and making adjustments in a very fluid way. And they capture a lot of extra sales because they have this flexibility.</p>\n<h2>How, You Ask?</h2>\n<p><strong>As an Example:</strong> One client had 800,000 units of single-packed women’s undergarments that didn’t sell through to Walmart. We accepted the return, bundled the returned units into 5 packs, created PDQs which we loaded with these 5 packs, and then our client resold ALL of that product to Walmart again.  And then the product did sell through.</p>\n<p>Another client had a 1.7MM unit order canceled by one major big box retailer. We accepted that return and rebranded all of those items so that the product could be sold to another large retailer within a few weeks, allowing this client to still capitalize on the seasonality of the product.</p>\n<p><strong>There are tons of examples like this. For instance, today at our facility we are doing </strong><strong>the following:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.renewallogistics.com/logistic-services/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Wholesale Prep:</strong></a> Today we’re taking 30,000 units of undergarments that came in from the factory in universal packaging, and customizing it for our clients’ wholesale customers’ vendor requirements.</p>\n<p>For instance, some companies like bag tags on the bottom right of a polybag, some like bag tags in the middle, and some like bag tags on the bottom left corner. Some want sports bras folded in half in the polybag, some want them unfolded in polybags. Today, we are prepping products for Urban Outfitters, Macy&#8217;s, Kohls.com, Bealls, and many many more. Every Retailer has a different set of requirements and on a given day we may be prepping product scheduled to go to 40-50 different retailers. We manage vendor guides for about 145 retailer clients.</p>\n<p>This means, our clients can be dynamic, selling as many products as they want to any of these 145 retailers, and within a few days have that product prepped and shipped.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.renewallogistics.com/amazon-fba-prep-services/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon FBA Prep</a>:</strong> We are the largest FBA prep facility in the country that we know of, and we do some days tens of thousands of units of FBA prep. Getting product packed in the right quantities, and with the right labels, creating shipping plans, etc for these goods to go to an Amazon Distribution Center. Amazon has exacting standards on how products are to arrive, and if items do not conform, there are high fees for fixing those issues. Today we’re prepping about 15,000 units for an athleisure brand to be sent to Amazon FBA.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.renewallogistics.com/apparel-services/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Kitting:</strong></a> We have a client right now that is asking us to print user manuals for one of their mechanical desks, and create kits consisting of those user manuals, the desk, and a riser. Our system is able to account for what quantities of stock are consumed by the kits so that the inventory stays clean in our WMS, and our employees physically create these kits, including labeling the bundle with a new SKU or UPC code.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.renewallogistics.com/e-commerce-and-retail-fulfillment/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">E-commerce Fulfillment Prep – Auditing:</a></strong> Today we are handling all of the audits for a client’s product that ultimately goes to Kohls.com for fulfillment. Kohls has very strict policies and chargebacks. The major challenge is that the chargebacks are based on a percentage of goods audited. But, if a problem is located, Kohls will increase the percentage of goods that must be audited from 2% to 5% to 10%. For each level of audit, the fees for nonconforming units go up. I saw a recent chargeback for $800 for 1 case with a wrinkled case label. By taking over this auditing process for this client, they’ve been able to go from a “D” to a “B” level vendor, in less than 6 months. In another 6 months, they’ll be an “A” level vendor!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.renewallogistics.com/subscription-box-fulfillment/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Subscription Box Assembly:</strong></a> We have a client that sells baby clothes that we’re creating gift boxes that include onesie sets, as well as bathing products, and a washcloth and towel. They are all put into a box in a certain order so that there is a beautiful unboxing experience.</p>\n<p>These are going out as a subscription box, but this client is also able to offer this gift as a stand-alone product through their holiday sales channels.</p>\n<p>We also perform gift wrapping for this client, so they’re able to increase their average revenue per order – without having to do this in-house, which would slow down their own facility and distract their own workforce.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.renewallogistics.com/logistic-services/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>End Cap Display Assembly:</strong></a> We are finalizing the shipments for 3,800 end cap displays that are going to Walmart to be on display through the holiday season. They came to us as flat corrugated pieces that we had to shape into an end cap display PDQ, and then fill with product, then create the outer shipper case and palletize. There were 50 different products<br />\non each display, in quantities of 5-20 units per SKU, to total around 450 different units on each display. At the end of the project, the <strong>3,800 displays were filled with over 1,710,000 </strong><strong>units of product.</strong> We do these with 100% accuracy. We’ve never failed an audit.</p>\n<p>This client was able to offer the creation of this end cap display program to Walmart to differentiate their products from their competition. It got their foot in the door for a much larger sales program than they were originally considered for.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.renewallogistics.com/mold-remediation-services/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Cleaning and Remediation Services:</strong></a> We’re doing a project right now of belts that came over from the factory for an accessories company, that had a musty smell and had some mildew. Apparently, the container had a moisture issue- which isn’t surprising since it sat on the water for an extra 90 days due to the port delays. We’re decontaminating this product so<br />\nthat it can be sold as first quality. We lab test goods to be sure that there is no contamination remaining. We’re cleaning about 30,000 belts in our facility this week.</p>\n<p>We also from time to time work with brands who have product that does not conform to the compliance guidelines for their retailers, and we will remediate nonconforming product so that it can be properly sold.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.renewallogistics.com/returns-and-circularity-services/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Returns:</strong></a> We manage the returns programs for some of the largest apparel retailers in the world.

    "web_content": "<h1>Diversifying Delivery Networks for Superior Customer Experiences</h1>\n<p>Retailers today are diversifying their delivery networks in order to better compete in last-mile delivery. Customers have come to expect fast, free, sustainable shipping and rate it as one of the most important aspects of their customer experience. Diversifying delivery networks creates logistics adaptability and resilience and allows retailers to achieve superior delivery experiences for their customers.</p>\n<p>Last-mile delivery is expensive, accounting for<a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Flast-mile-delivery-shipping-explained&amp;esheet=53291286&amp;newsitemid=20230126005266&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=53%25+of+overall+shipping+costs&amp;index=3&amp;md5=e458897e6f7a59e5e01cfbe14032e4d8\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> fifty-three percent of overall shipping costs</a>. In addition to being expensive, last-mile delivery is also complex and can be an inefficient process. In order to best compete in last-mile delivery,<a href=\"https://fareye.com/resources/reports-guides/eye-on-last-mile-retail\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> fifty-seven percent of retailers </a>report their last-mile delivery networks have become more outsourced in the past five years.</p>\n<p>According to FarEye’s 2023 ‘Eye on Last-Mile Delivery’ report, only thirty-four percent of retailers utilize their own fleets for deliveries. Retailers also outsource through the postal service, courier express and parcel (CEP) delivery companies and gig fleets to provide their last-mile deliveries.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>What are outsourced carrier networks?</h2>\n<p>Outsourced carriers are third-party companies contracted to carry a shipper&#8217;s product from one location to another. Using a network of outsourced carriers helps retailers provide their deliveries in a timely and efficient manner, with reduced capital investment, labor, and asset management costs.</p>\n<h2>How Using Outsourced Carriers Benefits Retailers</h2>\n<p>Retailers who outsource their last-mile deliveries claim they gain flexibility and speed. Sixty-four percent claim they have faster delivery times, according to the FarEye ‘Eye on Last-mile Delivery’ survey. Additional benefits include an increased capacity for deliveries and increased scalability.</p>\n<p>However, outsourcing deliveries to carriers does come with its own set of challenges.  The most commonly cited challenges by retailers include: high cost, inaccurate tracking, a lack of reliable information from the carrier, poor delivery quality and customer service, insufficient capacity, and a lack of customization and standardization on the deliveries.</p>\n<p>Although retailers typically gain flexibility when they outsource, many cede control of the delivery experience as well. Eighty-four percent of retailers claim their organization needs more control of their outsourced delivery networks, according to FarEye’s 2023 ‘Eye on Last-Mile Delivery’ survey.</p>\n<p>For retailers, effective carrier management is essential for an optimized last mile. It is difficult for companies to reduce their cost-per-delivery and provide a superior consumer experience without properly managing their carrier networks. How can they best manage their outsourced networks?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>How to manage outsourced carriers?</h2>\n<p>Shippers who choose to expand their carrier capacity and want to build an ecosystem of multiple carriers to fulfill demand will find that a whole new set of challenges arises with managing deliveries through multiple carriers.</p>\n<p>Carrier management includes choosing a set of carriers, tracking shipments, measuring their performance, managing their contracts, and ensuring compliance with regulations. Companies can best manage their outsourced carriers through carrier management software.</p>\n<p>Carrier management software, as part of a last-mile delivery platform, helps shippers manage carrier performance by providing real-time tracking and monitoring of shipments. It helps the shipper identify roadblocks that can occur while executing deliveries and facilitates quick resolution of delivery challenges.</p>\n<p>Carrier management software can also measure the performance of the chosen carriers. Metrics such as on-time delivery rates, transit times, and claims ratios can be used to evaluate carrier performance and make informed decisions about carrier selection and rate negotiation.</p>\n<h2>Benefits of Managing Carrier Networks</h2>\n<p>Retailers who manage their outsourced carriers with carrier management software will see lower delivery costs and more efficient deliveries while also providing superior customer experiences to today’s demanding consumers.</p>\n<h3>Lower Delivery Costs</h3>\n<p>Managing carriers through carrier management software means the software chooses the carrier with the best price and lowest cost delivery options. This allows the shipper to always get the best price-per-package and be able to control their shipping costs without relying upon one carrier.</p>\n<h3>Efficiency</h3>\n<p>Carrier management software helps automate carrier decisions, which makes the process more efficient. There is no second guessing or manual searching for the best rates as rates and routes are chosen based on pre-set criteria, making carrier selection easy, fast, and automated.</p>\n<h2>Diversified Delivery Networks Make Sense for Retailers</h2>\n<p>Retailers who want to use outsourced delivery networks also need a way to manage those networks and can best do it with a last-mile delivery platform that includes carrier management tools. Managing carriers allow retailers to simultaneously reduce delivery costs and enhance consumer delivery experiences, creating competitive advantages that translate to increased market share.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/episode-314-breaking-through-business-borders-broaden-your-reach-with-lean-solutions-group\">Watch the podcast episode where we take a full dive with FarEye.

    "web_content": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) was introduced in the 1960&#8217;s to allow businesses to communicate key business transactions such as purchase orders, advanced shipping notices, and invoices electronically instead of via paper providing fewer errors and more efficiencies. The concept was and still is great, it&#8217;s the execution that has failed. As supply chains continue to evolve and become more complex, the need for efficient and reliable data exchange becomes even more important. EDI provides a solid foundation for this exchange, however, the future of EDI must modernize the connectivity between companies in order to realize its full benefits.</p>\n<h4>A Quick History of EDI</h4>\n<p>In the early 90’s EDI became widely adopted as “the way” for businesses to exchange data. With adoption came standards and technology to assist companies in moving to this new way of doing business. Standards such as X12 and EDIFACT were introduced to help define the specifics of each type of document companies might want to exchange (ie Purchase Orders, Shipping Notices, Invoices, etc). These standards help define the data for each document and the way in which the documents need to be communicated. Technology companies arose to solve the complexities of mapping the data from your systems to this new required format and to transport the data from inside your company to your trading partner. However, as companies added more and more trading partners challenges started to become apparent.</p>\n<h4>The Challenges with EDI</h4>\n<p>One of the main challenges that every company faces with EDI is the time and resources it takes to onboard new trading partners. The average time to onboard and go live with a new partner is about 12 weeks and typically involves IT specialists, software developers, and EDI experts. This means that companies tend to invest heavily upfront in infrastructure and staff months before they can begin to monetize the relationship.</p>\n<p>Most EDI solutions are one off point to point custom solutions, making it difficult to add new trading partners or adapt to changing business needs without repeating the same painful process over and over. Additionally, once an EDI implementation has been built, companies spend weeks to months testing and validating their solutions before going live. The current testing process is very manual and time-consuming as it involves passing files back and forth, reviewing them manually, fixing tedious issues then doing it over and over until everyone agrees.</p>\n<p>To address these issues, it is important to adopt a more modern and agile approach to EDI. This should include the use of cloud-based solutions and API-driven architectures, which allow for real-time problem solving resulting in faster onboarding.</p>\n<h4>The Future of EDI: EDI Done Right</h4>\n<p>The future of EDI for supply chains is bright, and it requires a more modern and agile approach to implementation. <a href=\"https://www.orderful.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Modern EDI Platforms like Orderful</a> are on a mission to make trading with a new EDI partner as easy as flipping a light switch.

    "web_content": "<p>The transportation industry continues to grow ever more competitive, while concurrently facing mounting supply chain disruptions, congestion, parts and supply shortages, as well as ongoing labor shortages.</p>\n<p>While some of these challenges are beyond the control of fleet managers, others can be overcome through embracing and investing in transportation technology such as GPS asset-tracking devices. Here are the top seven benefits of using GPS equipment tracking for transportation businesses:</p>\n<h3><b>1. Real-Time Visibility of Assets and Equipment</b></h3>\n<p>The most obvious benefit of using GPS equipment tracking lies in the ability to see the specific location of each asset. Whether you’re looking for exact locations of trailers, cargo containers, or railcars, GPS tracking pinpoints each asset so that you know where it is in their journey, or if it’s sitting idle.</p>\n<p>Knowing exactly where each asset is at any given time, allows you to make adjustments such as rerouting to avoid congestion, adding a stop to load additional cargo, scheduling preventive maintenance, and keeping customers informed of estimated arrival times.</p>\n<h3><b>2. Insights for Fleet Managers</b></h3>\n<p>GPS equipment tracking allows fleet managers to create custom reports, which can provide greater insight into areas for cost savings. GPS tracking devices such as <a href=\"https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/products/asset-tracking/devices\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">BlackBerry Radar®</a> even provide multiple readings from a single device.</p>\n<p>In addition to providing fleet managers with accurate mileage, dozens of custom reports can be generated with a couple of clicks on a keyboard or phone. Reports can include mileage trends, cargo utilization, fleet utilization, dwell and detention times, and much more. This allows managers to identify areas of strength and illuminate weaknesses that need to be fortified.</p>\n<h3><b>3. Improve Fuel Usage</b></h3>\n<p>With fuel prices soaring to record highs, maximizing fuel usage is a priority for all fleet managers. GPS tracking devices can provide satellite images of each asset so that you can route drivers around congestion that would otherwise have them sitting idle, wasting fuel and time.</p>\n<h3><b>4. Reduce Operational Costs</b></h3>\n<p>Real-time visibility and improved insights help to significantly reduce operational costs. Implementing automation through tracking software often means that you don’t have to hire another back-office employee. You can ensure you’re billing accurately for dwell and detention, maximize fuel usage, and reduce wasted operator time, thus improving operator satisfaction and reducing turnover.   Additionally, utilizing GPS equipment tracking may include the additional advantage of earning you an insurance discount, further reducing your operating costs.</p>\n<h3><b>5. Improved Safety</b></h3>\n<p>GPS tracking allows for pre-scheduling of all maintenance, including selecting the service center most convenient to a particular route. This reduces the likelihood of breakdowns and reduces wasted time while ensuring that equipment is well-maintained and safe.  Moreover, custom reports can alert you to drivers or operators who are compromising safety by exceeding speed limits or logging too many miles per day.</p>\n<h3><b>6. Rapid Response to Theft</b></h3>\n<p>GPS tracking devices that are equipped to send open/close alerts can notify you instantly of attempted theft. Authorities can be notified immediately to recover your railcar, trailer, and even cargo.</p>\n<h3><b>7. Greater Customer Satisfaction</b></h3>\n<p>Real-time departures and tracking of each shipment’s journey allows you to manage expectations and provide timely notification to your customers of early arrivals, or unexpected delays. Improved communication with customers based on knowing the precise location of each shipment or asset offers the additional benefits of building trust and strengthening relationships.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><b>Bringing the Benefits of GPS Equipment Tracking Home to Your Fleet<br />\n</b></h4>\n<p>Remember these seven benefits when you’re considering upgrading or expanding your fleet’s GPS-tracking capabilities, and when you’re searching for a qualified provider to help you take advantage of the latest advances.</p>\n<p>When the time is right to make your move, we hope you’ll consider <a href=\"https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/products/asset-tracking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">BlackBerry Radar</a>, which can collect <a>up to 100 times</a> more data than basic GPS equipment tracking devices.

    "web_content": "<p>As supply chain leaders strive to truly transform their businesses and become digital at the core, what does it take to achieve a true digital transformation?</p>\n<p>In my conversations with supply chain leaders around the world, some common themes keep coming up: <em>How do I plan and execute at the pace needed today?  How do I find the people and technology resources to analyze the data, identify the issues, and take action? How do I make the best decisions at the moment of maximum impact, while minimizing bias and uncertainty?</em></p>\n<p>Despite spending years building solutions to enhance productivity and visibility, companies simply can’t keep up with the volume and pace of decision making in today’s digital world. Labor volatility has magnified this: without enough time or people to address decision making, many decisions are left unmade – each one a missed opportunity to reduce costs, increase revenue, or mitigate potential risk.</p>\n<p>One of our customers shared that many of his company’s past efforts at data science and digital automation – from RPA to robotics, and more – had focused on digitizing processes, or what he called “doing digital.”</p>\n<p>The key to success, as he noted, is moving from “doing digital” to actually <em>being digital</em>, focusing on digitizing the decisions that must be made.</p>\n<h4><strong>The New Competitive Advantage: Decision Automation</strong></h4>\n<p>This is the promise of Decision Intelligence – the digitization, augmentation, and automation of decision making. Instead of relying on people to analyze data, dashboards, and information, it applies the computational power of machines and AI to do this work more quickly, and at scale.</p>\n<p>Our platform, <a href=\"https://www.aeratechnology.com/decision-cloud\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Aera Decision Cloud<sup>TM</sup></a>, harmonizes data, applies decision logic, executes decisions by writing back to a company’s source systems, and learns from the outcome and context of each decision made.</p>\n<p>This learning capability is the key to truly <em>being digital</em>. It provides a new source of competitive advantage by enabling automated decision making and capturing a digital memory of actions taken.</p>\n<p>Our customers in life sciences, CPG, petrochemicals, high tech and other industries have moved from “human-in-the-loop” decision making (where users review the generated recommendations and manually accept them) to reorganizing their businesses to capitalize on real-time decision automation. These decisions range from changing suppliers based on OTIF performance, to adjusting manufacturing capacity utilization based on demand, to rerouting inventory around delays – and more.</p>\n<p>One of our customers in consumer goods has surpassed 1 million automated recommendations, with tens of millions of dollars in increased sales thanks to improvements in replenishment and service. Another customer in life sciences reduced inventory by 10 percent, while cutting product waste by 3 percent.</p>\n<h4><strong>The Self-Healing, Self-Taught Supply Chain</strong></h4>\n<p>For years we’ve focused on creating self-healing supply chains that adjust to volatility – but today, we can transform supply chain ecosystems by identifying new opportunities based on what they learn.</p>\n<p>Companies can use AI to find patterns and reveal new opportunities. For example, supply chain leaders are using Aera Decision Cloud<sup>™</sup> on top of their digital twin technology for improved visibility, as well as the ability to detect issues and opportunities in real time.</p>\n<p>Going forward, we’ll see the emergence of new roles and functions for supply chains and beyond. Teams of the future will include decision analysts and decision architects who will find the best ways to define, make, and execute decisions. Those team members will help companies drive innovation and improve performance.</p>\n<p>This revolution is already happening around us.</p>\n<p>The time to start this journey is now. Companies should begin leveraging decision automation technology to capture a permanent memory of decisions as a foundation for future learning.</p>\n<p>With this knowledge in hand, supply chain teams can decide whether to simply capture institutional knowledge or take full advantage of Decision Intelligence to automate decisions and reveal new opportunities.</p>\n<p>As more day-to-day decisions are automated, less time will be spent on repetitive and transactional activities – and more time on strategy, creativity, and teamwork. Companies will discover more new, innovative, and creative ways to serve customers in a more efficient, data-driven world.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>About the Author</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-15931\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Fred-Laluyaux_CEO_Aera-Technology-300x249.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"249\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Fred-Laluyaux_CEO_Aera-Technology-300x249.jpeg 300w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Fred-Laluyaux_CEO_Aera-Technology-1024x850.jpeg 1024w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Fred-Laluyaux_CEO_Aera-Technology-768x638.jpeg 768w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Fred-Laluyaux_CEO_Aera-Technology-600x498.jpeg 600w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Fred-Laluyaux_CEO_Aera-Technology.jpeg 1180w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" />Fred Laluyaux is a thought leader on the future of work and Decision Intelligence for the enterprise.

    "web_content": "<p>The past few years have been challenging as far as supply chain goes, and it doesn’t look like things will improve any time soon. IndustryWeek recommends that manufacturers minimize their risk and exposure by implementing digitalization strategies and a management operating system that provides better visibility across the supply chain and improving data capture and integrity.</p>\n<p>Manufacturers typically have complex supply chain environments, with processes that are based on agreements and blanket orders with inherent ordering rules and conditions around pricing, shipping, and deliveries, as well as processes with mandated supply chain rules, and special delivery scheduling and conditions. Such environments could involve orders with hundreds of line items, partial shipments per line, and multiple receiving and invoices per line, as well as processes that include intermediate warehousing, import via sea or air freight, and more. In such environments, enterprises invest a significant amount of time and effort ensuring that suppliers comply with their business rules and policies, following up on order fulfillment, supply chain execution and on-time delivery, validating invoices, handling invoice reconciliation processes, validating payments, handling a significant number of errors and discrepancies, and preventing fraud. Additionally, complex environments often involve multiple geographies and the associated differing rules, regulations, and cultures, as well as the presence of multiple applications and ERP systems.</p>\n<p>In recent discussions with three major industry players from the Oil and Gas industry, semiconductors, and aerospace industry, common themes emerged. All three used to suffer from inefficient supply chains, which resulted from bad supplier relations. Bad supplier relations developed because of an inefficient invoice management mechanism, and it was digitalization, visibility, and data capture and integrity that made a difference. When suppliers are in the dark about the status of their invoices and find themselves repeatedly inquiring about the payment date, that’s bad news for their customers. If weeks go by before finding out that the invoice was incorrect or has some other issue that prevents its payment, that’s even worse.</p>\n<p>Bad supplier relations resulting from inefficient invoice management systems could lead to supply chain gaps that negatively impact production lines, which is bad for business. That’s precisely what these three companies used to suffer from. All that changed once these three leading corporations implemented an automation system that provided suppliers with invoice submission guidance aligned with corporate business rules and policies, efficiently validated each invoice for accuracy, and created complete transparency into invoice status and payment date. Knowing right away that an invoice is approved or rejected and being able to plan their cash flow has had a tremendous impact on these suppliers, reducing uncertainty, and freeing them from having to manually inquire about invoice and payment status. For these buyers, the impact was clear: supplier relations improved, errors were removed, paperwork disappeared, and most importantly – their supply chain became more efficient and reliable.</p>\n<p>The automation system that these companies implemented addresses source-to-pay activities across direct and indirect spend, utilizing hundreds of software bots and relying on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning technologies to provide sophisticated document review and validation within context of the entire workflow. Because of the value it delivers to suppliers, over 90% of them fully participate in the process, which covers close to 100% of invoices and over 90% of spend. While a source-to-pay process automation tool may not address all supply chain challenges, it could have a significant impact on production lines and on the competitive nature of both buyers and suppliers and is an important factor contributing to improved buyer-supplier relations. So, if you want an efficient supply chain – don’t mess with your suppliers, collaborate with them!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>About the Author</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-15742 size-medium alignleft\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Ilan_small-Ilan-Friedman-300x273.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"273\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Ilan_small-Ilan-Friedman-300x273.jpg 300w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Ilan_small-Ilan-Friedman-768x698.jpg 768w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Ilan_small-Ilan-Friedman-600x546.jpg 600w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Ilan_small-Ilan-Friedman.jpg 839w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" />Ilan is the Senior Director of Global Marketing at Nipendo as well as a veteran international business executive.

    "web_content": "<p>It&#8217;s only recently that companies have realized the power that product and procurement teams have in solving the challenge of decarbonization. Early approaches have been to build small corporate sustainability teams dedicated to collecting and reporting data. However, their lack of departmental expertise and integration meant that there remained a disconnect between the problem and the solution. The next generation of approaches has been to embed those very experts within product and procurement teams to work alongside them in identifying, evaluating, and implementing opportunities to decarbonize – what some people call “co-creation&#8221;.</p>\n<p>While this approach is a massive improvement, as is evident in the amount of action (some good, some counterproductive) we are seeing in the business world today, it still has some challenges preventing the explosion of decarbonization activities across our value chains. We’ve gathered the three biggest challenges that procurement teams are currently facing and how they can overcome them.</p>\n<h4><strong>Changing suppliers is hard</strong></h4>\n<p>Assuming you magically know the difference in impacts for a product sourced from two different suppliers (and this is not a trivial problem), switching them is sometimes a much bigger challenge. Some companies we have spoken with have been buying from the same supplier for decades. Especially in spaces where compliance and the approval of certain parts or materials play a crucial role, companies like to stay with the one process they have successfully set up and gotten certified. Still, with more disruptions, geopolitics, regulations, and a movement towards more sustainable production, locations, and suppliers, procurement professionals have no other option than to take on the challenge. When changing suppliers is not an option, developing deep collaborations around sustainability with the suppliers is the only alternative. It is hard and time-consuming, but efforts in the Automotive industry have proven that this approach works when there is a financial model behind the initiatives.</p>\n<h4><strong>The deep tiers of supply chains are a mystery</strong></h4>\n<p>While insights into tier 1 of the supply chain are hard to get for many procurement teams, the deeper tiers are a mystery for most companies. Take buying a printed wiring board (PCB) as an example. The biggest impact in its supply chain stems from the chip that is soldered onto the wiring board. While you might know some information about the PCB manufacturer, it is extremely hard to have any information about the chip maker. Here you need to get creative and use proxy information to estimate impacts to understand the main drivers and opportunities as a first step. Focused data collection programs supported by your tier 1 suppliers can help get more granularity and accuracy from deeper in the supply chain. Industry-wide programs for compliance are a good place to start for such information. When switching to suppliers that take accountability for sustainability within their supply chains is not an option, collaboration between design teams and your suppliers is the next step in implementing changes.</p>\n<h4><strong>Lack of actionable data for non-experts </strong></h4>\n<p>Procurement teams today lack easy access to actionable and accurate data. Knowing the average impact of steel per kilogram does not help if the sourcing action is for an assembly – procurement folks are not carbon accounting experts. Understanding variability across suppliers and geographies at the component level is crucial to evaluate if there is an opportunity for optimization in the first place. Going further, making tradeoffs requires understanding the implications of other buying criteria like quality, costs, risks, and compliance. Without this data, no decision can be made. For procurement teams to integrate sustainability into their processes naturally, carbon must become just another number on their spreadsheet, next to price, risk, and all the other categories procurement teams go through when choosing a supplier.</p>\n<h4><strong> Actionable data and supplier-specific insights with Makersite</strong></h4>\n<p>Makersite enables procurement professionals to solve two of these three problems – creating more transparency into deeper tiers and quantifying the impacts of changes to these supply chains across crucial buying criteria. Our product lifecycle intelligence platform maps a company’s product data against more than 140 external databases, producing a digital twin of the product and its supply chain – from cradle to grave. This way, procurement teams can not only see how their product performs across more than 40 categories, including environmental, cost, risk, and compliance categories but also how changes to the material and the supply chain would affect them. With our external databases, <a href=\"https://makersite.io/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Makersite covers more than 35% of the world’s supply chains with a supplier-specific approach, and integrated data collection tools can be used for more targeted transparency.</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/episode-324-source-smarter-design-greener-and-collaborate-faster-with-makersite/\">Check out Makersite&#8217;s podcast episode—all about sourcing smarter, designing greener and collaborating faster.</a></h4>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3vn-tkoUsUU\" width=\"640\" height=\"498\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>About the Author</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-15666 size-medium alignleft\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_9289-Laura-Nodoph-1-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_9289-Laura-Nodoph-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_9289-Laura-Nodoph-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_9289-Laura-Nodoph-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_9289-Laura-Nodoph-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_9289-Laura-Nodoph-1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_9289-Laura-Nodoph-1-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/neil-dsouza-b514a6183/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Neil D’Souza</a> is the CEO and founder of <a href=\"https://makersite.io/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Makersite</a>, a company that uses AI, data, and apps to power sustainable product and supply chain decisions at scale.

Tendai boasts over two decades in supply chain and leadership roles with a Master&#8217;s in Manufacturing Information Systems from the University of Auckland and a Bachelor&#8217;s in Electrical Engineering from McMaster University. She is dedicated to aligning supply chain and business strategies, leveraging end-to-end supply chain visibility, and delivering better outcomes via robust scenario planning and innovative process improvement. Tendai is a highly collaborative, conceptual thinker who is passionate about working strategically with a coalition of partners to achieve early wins, alignment, and success.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>    1. How did your supply chain journey start?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>I was raised in a household of strong women leaders. My mother is 95 years now. She raised us to believe in ourselves. There was never a task restricted to a woman or man’s work. That’s the mentality my mother sent me into the universe with, along with the endless support and love of my twin sister, Tafadzwa. My sister has made such a huge difference in my personal and professional life, always ready with a shoulder to lean on, no matter the circumstances. I grew up in rural Zimbabwe. We grew all our food and sold some for cash. My mum expected us to work before and after school, instilling a strong work ethic in both of us from a very young age. Tafazdwa and I left home for high school when we were fourteen years old, and that started our adventures. We knew that our work needed to be successful, we didn’t have electricity in our house so we used to study in the council study rooms that were 5km away, usually finishing around 11 or midnight. The only other people out when we went to head home were drunks. Unbelievably, people even accused us of prostitution because of the late hours we spent studying. But Tafazdwa and I never let that bother us. We kept working and studying late at night, and we were rewarded. All those late nights studying scored me scholarships to study Engineering in Canada, which was the beginning of the doors opening for me. My first job was working on the electrical wiring of commercial buildings. Then I moved on to consulting, which got me hooked on supply chain. Today, I have been in supply chain now for more than 25 years. I’ve had the privilege of working at many of New Zealand’s largest companies, providing plenty of learning opportunities. I have now had the honor of leading people and inspiring a few on the way. My focus now is to train and empower the next generation of women leaders in supply chain.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>    2. How have mentors supported your career growth in the supply chain?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>My mother raised us to have a great work ethic and not to limit ourselves to gender stereotypes around what work women should do. But I never had a professional mentor in the traditional sense. Not officially. I have always learned from those around me. I am also very fortunate that my twin sister Tafadzwa has been a lifelong companion. We have coached and mentored each other over and over again. Additionally, I have a progressive husband who supports all my personal and professional aspirations.  </p>\r\n<h4><strong>    3. Tell us about what it&#8217;s like to be a woman in a male-dominated industry:</strong></h4>\r\n<p>In retrospect, maybe because of how I was raised and the close family ties to women throughout my lifetime, it has never been an issue for me. Maybe because, like when Tafadzwa and I had wild accusations aimed at us for keeping late hours studying because of our gender, I’ve never let what others think phase me. I have always felt that I am where I am meant to be—without questioning my purpose or potential. In high school, my twin and I always hung out with the boys because of the STEM subjects we embraced: mathematics, physics, and chemistry. Over the last two years of high school, we had just four girls in our class of 22. Sadly, the numbers haven’t changed for the next generation—I see those same male-to-female student ratios for my daughter in her classes. University was the same. Normally, I look around the room, and not only am I often the only woman, but I am also the only black person. Sometimes the room is bigger than me, with more diversity, so I learn. When the room is smaller, my hope is I can teach a few people who will walk away with some of my experience. I have never felt limited because of who I am or my gender.</p>\r\n<h4> </h4>\r\n<h4><strong>     4. When did you find your voice among women leaders in supply chain?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>I’ve always had a strong voice. Sometimes it was a roar, and that got me in trouble. Sometimes it was a whisper, or I was silent altogether because I could not afford the consequences.  As I matured and became more financially secure, I’ve been comfortable being open and more vocal about the things I care most about. If I were to pinpoint a moment when my professional voice and mentality really clicked into place, it started about three years ago. I took a leadership mindset course at Auckland University. Through that process, I was able to connect the outer world to the inner realities that I have always had.  </p>\r\n<h4>     5. <strong>What’s next on your supply chain journey?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>I have learned that I have the tools I need to be anything—to create and realize my greatest ambitions and aspirations. Looking ahead, I still have many mountains to climb, giving back to my community, documenting our family history, and of course, supporting my family.  I just hope I have the time.  </p>\r\n<h4>      6. <strong> What advice do you have for women on how we can all close the gender gap in supply chain?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Believe in yourself. Your inner realities shape your outer form. Second, find someone who believes in you but, most important, challenges you and gives you straightforward feedback. My mother has always said that if you know you are doing something wrong, and no one offers guidance—leave. Find a better place and advocates who care about your future. “Feedback is a gift.” If success is an equation and you fall <em>n </em>times, get up up <em>n+1. </em>Never stop getting back up—that’s what can help you realize your greatest aspirations.  </p>\r\n<h4>      7. <strong>What are the major milestones you’re working towards this year?</strong></h4>\r\n<p>  In a year, I hope I am a better leader and that I’ve created better outcomes for my team and others whom I care about. I also want to write a business case for the “Zim project” about giving back to my community—sharing it with potential investors. Finally, I aim to record ten to fifteen hours of my family history to pass on for generations to come.

    "web_content": "<p>We learned an important lesson in 2022 &#8211; The industry is changing, and we need to change with it. More now than ever, brokerages understand the importance of strategic planning and positioning themselves to handle whatever comes next. Make 2023 the year you start booking freight more effectively and efficiently by making these four changes to remain competitive.</p>\n<h4>1. Expand your carrier base &#8211; take more risks!</h4>\n<p>A broker is only as good as their network of carriers. When the lane comes that you don&#8217;t have the capacity for, how will you procure new carriers to book the freight? Unfortunately, many brokers don&#8217;t strategically approach building their carrier network proactively. Instead, brokers often rely heavily on load boards and historical data to source carriers.</p>\n<p>The depth of a broker&#8217;s carrier network has a substantial impact on pricing and procurement decisions. Your goal should be creating a deep carrier network with several carriers you can turn to if the first one can&#8217;t service a load. Expanding your network will help you generate the options needed to ensure top-tier service levels for your customers.</p>\n<h4>2. Create better conversations for a bigger outcome</h4>\n<p>Who wants to make 60 calls a day to book one load? The overuse of transactional carriers can be a massive barrier to a brokerage trying to scale. The problems with transactional carriers can be obvious &#8211; they have no relationship with your company, so they have no incentive to provide preferred pricing or service. Brokers should focus on building their existing relationships by driving freight to their core carriers. An essential component of this is having meaningful conversations with carriers to learn more about their business.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<p>What lanes do you run? What frequency do you run those lanes? What commodities do you haul? Where do you need help filling your trucks? Asking the right questions and learning about a carrier&#8217;s business helps brokers better identify compatible lanes and build more long-term relationships. The more you set up consistent carriers, the more freight you can handle, the more business you&#8217;ll get, and the easier life will be.</p>\n<h4>3. Develop a pricing strategy and stick to it</h4>\n<p>A broker&#8217;s pricing strategy is a key component to winning new business. Quote too high, and you won&#8217;t win the business; quote too low, and you&#8217;ll lose money trying to service it. However, many brokers approach pricing through a combination of tribal knowledge and gut reactions…often applied to delayed data. The result is an inaccurate and inconsistent process that inhibits growth.</p>\n<p>To develop an effective pricing strategy, brokers must emphasize a more data-driven approach to pricing. While there&#8217;s value in having experience pricing freight, that experience is more valuable when it&#8217;s supported by the right data.</p>\n<p>For instance, rather than relying on delayed data, use a pricing tool that provides real-time rate information to have a more up-to-date view of current market conditions. Using a pricing tool with up-to-the-minute accuracy not only helps you forecast a true prediction of the market but helps to protect margins and profits.</p>\n<h4>4. Let your tech complement your process</h4>\n<p>The transportation industry has a reputation for lagging behind concerning technology, and brokers are no exception. While notepads and spreadsheets may have gotten the job done twenty years ago, they are no longer enough to be competitive. Many brokerages didn&#8217;t have a tech play until the pandemic. Luckily, technology is your friend. However, it&#8217;s crucial to partner with the right technology. What gaps do you need to fill? How will this new software impact your employees?</p>\n<p>Nowadays, Brokers are looking for software to fill those gaps, streamline their processes, and reduce the noise of so many applications by finding compatible partners that integrate with their TMS. Although this industry remains relationship-based, adopting new technologies makes those relationships easier to grow and maintain. Take the time to learn what new technology is out there to help your brokerage source new capacity, expand lane coverage, gain real-time market rates, and automate labor-intensive tasks.</p>\n<p>In a competitive industry, don&#8217;t let the old-school way of booking freight hold you back. While there are thousands of registered freight brokers, the vast majority either go out of business or plateau at a certain level. If the last few years taught you anything, you must be proactive and prepared because the next market shift is bound to happen sooner than later.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><a href=\"https://blog.cargochief.com/cs/c/?cta_guid=ec8998f6-4944-48fa-b7d7-81c8e249d9a2&amp;signature=AAH58kHcvpZg461qY3CMR0tDaRV0YxWkSw&amp;pageId=89272796504&amp;placement_guid=b18ee95f-dc03-41f2-a743-59378f368b96&amp;click=0830cede-f6c8-498a-89bd-68d341891e6b&amp;hsutk=6907249bfe17dd1688d2d8a46a7e8b1e&amp;canon=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.cargochief.com%2Fchanges-freight-brokers-must-make-to-remain-competitive&amp;portal_id=8340302&amp;redirect_url=APefjpFRJHhxo0U9iS7NKe2H0dxUOnAYPIxYC90MSmumvFfQZoDArfxDACv_saI3oBx-eOsTLby46oL0-eNigF1jENu7M7ubvHo4ORNcMeChbY8ylbfRYzyHRey8uN62fUyO2SXact6M&amp;__hstc=153699047.6907249bfe17dd1688d2d8a46a7e8b1e.1668631229543.1668631229543.1668631229543.1&amp;__hssc=153699047.1.1668631229543&amp;__hsfp=2488950608&amp;contentType=blog-post\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Book more freight in 2023 with C4&#8217;s Project &amp; Procurement Platform.

    "web_content": "<p>Customers want their items fast, free, and on-time. It’s your job as a retail logistics operator to put their needs and desires first and use the best carrier for the job, not just the one you are locked into. I learned the value of this lesson in the early 2000’s when helping Amazon switch from solo dependency on UPS to a multi-carrier mix to drive shipping speed and cost improvements.</p>\n<p>The power of flexibility is available to everyone and starts by ditching the single-carrier relationship model you’ve been reliant on for years. It’s not getting better—in fact the performance of each of the three national carriers has steadily declined due to structural issues including poor earnings, supply chain issues and constrained labor.</p>\n<p>Despite the threat of inflation, consumer spending online is on track to hit the $1 Trillion mark in 2022. To take advantage every retailer should adopt a multi-carrier model to put the customer experience first.</p>\n<h3>Single Carrier? Single Failure</h3>\n<p>What’s wrong with the single-carrier model? To find out, we indexed the top 750 eCommerce retailers by annual online revenue based on the industry data provided by EcommerceDB.com. We investigated their online shipping policies and went through the buying process to view shipping options at checkout. We then cold cross-referenced whether or not a given retailer used a single carrier.</p>\n<p>We found 22% or 165 retailers stated or demonstrated that they used a single carrier. An additional 17%, or 127 retailers, used two carriers, but the format was primarily relying on one of FedEx or UPS, then using The Postal Service for P.O. Boxes only.</p>\n<p>Combined, 39% or 292 of the top 750 online retailers relied on a single carrier. That’s a lot of assumed risk during peak shopping seasons.</p>\n<p>Moving from a single to multiple carrier strategy helps you get out from under the thumb of carrier limits or poor performance. It also provides the modern operations leader the ability to arbitrage services to drive the best rate. This is the fastest way to reduce costs while ensuring performance remains acceptable.</p>\n<h3>Carrier Flexibility = Customer Loyalty</h3>\n<p>Fixing this problem requires both a business strategy and a technology solution working in partnership.</p>\n<p>The business portion is logically simple: secure more contracts, like regional carriers, specific to your shipping profile either directly or through a third-party logistics provider.</p>\n<p>The technical solution has historically been complex, requiring multi-month TMS integration and lots of manual analysis to configure for fast or low-cost shipping options (but typically not both). This painful work is the reason why 39% of the top 750 retailers still rely on a single carrier solution; change has been too painful.</p>\n<p>Enter Shipium. We help retail businesses put logistics management technology at the center of their growth strategy. Retailers can plug in carriers and optimize their last mile instantly to improve delivery speed and reduce shipping costs. The resulting carrier flexibility delivers shipping speed, which makes online shoppers very, very happy.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/episode299-ecommerce-supply-chain/\">Hear from Jason as he chats with Sarah Barnes-Humphrey all about how to step up your e-commerce game.</a></h4>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zgUHSnJui80\" width=\"640\" height=\"498\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">﻿</span></iframe></p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll hear about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Jason’s long-standing career at Amazon, and how his experiences led him to co-found Shipium.</li>\n<li>The technology behind the Shipium platform, and a closer look at the onboarding and implementation process.</li>\n<li> The next stage of the ecommerce evolution, and the role that home delivery will increasingly play in successful business strategies.

    "web_content": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When pressed, most eCommerce fulfillment operators will admit that their parcel shipments could likely be packed a little better. The trouble is, they might say, this is only one fire out of a thousand they’re putting out during any given week, and just getting orders out the door is the priority. Suboptimal packing is often seen as just “the cost of doing business.” Besides, how bad can the packing problem really be if people are still buying our stuff online?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It turns out, bad. Really bad. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A little air or extra fill material in any given carton seems fixable, but most shippers are leaving thousands and in many cases millions of dollars on the warehouse floor by not optimizing their boxes for their unique fulfillment costs. The problem, which is largely underappreciated by most eCom shippers, is two-fold:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Humans are quite bad at judging three-dimensional space at a glance. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cubic utilization is </span><b>not</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the only metric that matters.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s start with the first issue, which is that spatial reasoning is not an innate talent humans excel at. This is especially true in a fast-paced fulfillment environment. A survey by DS Smith asked eCom execs how much void space they think is in their outgoing cartons, and on average they guessed 25%. A large-scale study of those shipments showed that the truth was closer to 50%, and up to 64% in some product categories. Oops. That’s a lot of spare cardboard and cubic volume, and because most eCommerce shipments are put into floor-loaded trailers, a lot of unnecessary truck trips over time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s “unpack” the second problem: When a supply chain manager or senior analyst commits to fixing the issue of inefficient packing, they almost never consider the fact that reducing air is only half the battle. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As may seem perfectly reasonable, our efficiency-seeking hero might turn to a box-making machine or a generic 3D cubing algorithm to “right size” their cartons, hopefully dispatching the air problem with great prejudice. So what’s the issue? The issue is that these strategies myopically focus on shrinking the carton(s) in front of them, and ignore the actual journey that any given shipment might take. The fact is, the speed and distance a shipment takes affect how many boxes it should be split up into. And the major parcel carriers make everyone pay for this mistake.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In practice, this means a multi-item shipment going a few zip codes over from the origin is more forgiving of wasted space but penalizes additional boxes relatively more. Conversely, any air in a longer-distance shipment will generally be more expensive, but splitting it up into multiple boxes will be penalized relatively less. And it gets more convoluted—in addition to distance traveled, FedEx and UPS carrier service types enforce their own special packing incentives.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The result is that whatever savings a shipper might achieve by leveraging legacy cartonization software, they could be saving 20% more by incorporating their unique rates in the equation. With this in mind, it becomes clear that most eCom shippers are well aware that there’s a problem, they mostly just don’t realize the complex nature of it nor how much money could be saved.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So how can the average operation built on standardization possibly be agile enough to navigate the incentives in their rate tables when packing parcel shipments? With a multi-item shipment, a packer (or a box machine for that matter) can’t possibly determine how their complex cost structures inform how a shipment should actually be packed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is why we built </span><a href=\"https://paccurate.io\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paccurate</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It’s a real-time cartonization API that not only reduces the average cube of all outgoing parcel shipments but ensures every relevant cost is accounted for in each packing decision. Labor costs, material costs, and even entire negotiated rate tables are analyzed in milliseconds and used to generate packing instructions for those harried humans and/or machines in the warehouse. Now, with the </span><a href=\"https://paccurate.io/pacsimulate\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PacSimulate </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">platform, the same cost-optimizing technology can be used to determine which size cartons should be used for shipping in every DC and store.</span></p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/episode297-packing-decisions-paccurate/\">Hear from James as he chats with Sarah Barnes-Humphrey all about making smarter packing decisions on the Let&#8217;s Talk Supply Chain™ Podcast.</a></h4>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>About the Author</h2>\n<p><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-14727 alignleft\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/packing-300x201.png\" alt=\"packing-on-lets-talk-supply-chain\" width=\"300\" height=\"201\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/packing-300x201.png 300w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/packing.png 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" />Working in the logistics tech space since 2009, James has helped design a variety of enterprise shipping technology including an award-winning multi-carrier TMS.

A self-described culture enthusiast, Shannon is a Revenue Leader with an emphasis on Freight Tech, Block Chain, and Supply Chain. She boasts nearly three decades of experience in supply chain and operations and is the Vice President of Sales for BlackBerry Radar, overseeing the company&#8217;s Strategic Growth and Adoption. Shannon is the Global Strategy Vice President of the Blockchain Supply Chain Association,  an advisory role that keeps her committed to promoting Blockchain awareness, education, and adoption across the logistics, transportation, and supply chain community.  She achieved a degree in Operational Leadership at Queen&#8217;s University through its business program after earning a bachelor&#8217;s degree in Anthropology from McMaster University. Shannon has a master&#8217;s in Leadership from the York University Schulich School of Business. </span></p>\r\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">     1. How did your supply chain journey lead you to where you are today?</span></h4>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started my career in operations, regularly tasked with fixing problems and improving processes. I was trusted to lead small teams early in my career. I quickly grew my experience and responsibility—leading larger teams and cross-function business groups. </span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In customer-facing roles, I&#8217;ve worked directly with them to get the most out of the solutions I represented. I built a track record of being the &#8220;build it/fix it person,&#8221; known for developing highly-engaged teams and regularly challenging the status quo. </span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While supporting our B2B sales organization at American Express, I was approached by a leader I greatly respected who suggested making a career change to a leadership role over a sales team.  I had never considered myself a salesperson, but I knew I was passionate about our business. I was confident I could be a good leader for the team, so I took a considerable risk. I stepped out of my comfort zone and into something I had never done before.  It was a fantastic decision, and I have enjoyed being in sales ever since.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since then, I&#8217;ve moved across industries, tapping into my sales and leadership skills, working for organizations that are disrupting traditional business processes.  Working in operations, customer success, and sales have given me a deeper perspective on how all parts of an organization need to work together. You need to connect the dots and have all the functions in alignment to deliver for the customers and build a profitable competitive company with a resilient supply chain.  Today I am leading Global Growth and Adoption for Blackberry Radar where I am able to leverage all of my functional experience across transportation and supply chain to help organizations to maximize and extend the use of their asset management data.</span></p>\r\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">         2. What drew you into the Blockchain thought leadership community? </span></h4>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You get to experience firsthand how interconnected all the functions are—supply chain in a microcosm. Just before COVID, I found myself joining an emerging technology company focused on enterprise Blockchain.  I was collaborating with supply chain leaders on problem areas where multiple parties rely on information sharing necessary to improve processes in support of the movement of goods.  Retail, CPG, and Manufacturing—all of it exposed me to the challenges across the supply chain and the need to foster ecosystems of companies that benefit from working together to solve their supply chain issues.  </span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many organizations compete on the shelves, but as an industry, they want to work together on innovation while sharing best practices.  </span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discovering the importance of information sharing led me to advocate for harnessing data to improve business processes. Data without workflow or logic isn&#8217;t smart data.  You need to be curious to learn and understand how companies work internally and across the supply chain.  Often when you can identify where friction or re-work happens, there is an opportunity to harness data more effectively. Ensuring all stakeholders have visibility and can share data with trust and transparency can be a game changer.</span></p>\r\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">      3.  What has your experience been as a woman working in a historically male-dominated industry?</span></h4>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have to be honest. There have been challenges, and it can be tough to have your point of view heard.  I&#8217;ve learned to work at building consensus outside of meetings. That means working with individuals to understand their goals and needs and then collaborating in a larger forum to bring them together to provide decision-making support. </span></p>\r\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">      4. Have you had a mentor in your career? How did they help?</span></h4>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;ve been fortunate to have had a few critical mentors throughout my career.  They all challenged me to think differently, gave open, direct feedback when others refrained, building trust and encouraging me to take risks.  </span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A great mentor also taught me that taking on mentees is always an opportunity to learn more about yourself. It&#8217;s never a one-sided relationship, and you should embrace learning from one another.</span></p>\r\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">      5. Who inspires you in or outside of the logistics and transportation industry?</span></h4>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outside the industry and for leadership inspiration, I love Simon Sinek!  </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leaders Eat Last </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start with Why</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are gems. Simon Sinek shares that  &#8220;People don&#8217;t buy </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">what</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you do; they buy </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">why</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you do it.  Also,  &#8220;(a) great leader will always put [themself] last.&#8221;   In Sinek&#8217;s opinion, &#8220;[t]he true price of leadership is the willingness to place the needs of others above your own.&#8221;</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inside the industry,  I admireJohn Bayliss, Executive Vice President, Transformation Officer at Walmart Canada. Just before COVID, we were collaborating on a highly visible project using emerging technology.  When many leaders decided to park or postpone projects, John pushed his entire team and all of us to see the project through.  He had great vision. John is highly thoughtful about his team and the business partners he relies on across his supply chain.</span></p>\r\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">     6. When did you find your voice and bring your authentic self into your career in supply chain?</span></h4>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being authentic matters. You can drive the highest sales and cost savings, but if you aren&#8217;t trusted or approachable, you&#8217;ll be challenged to build a highly engaged team. You need that for a team that wants to put all their effort into what you are striving to achieve.  </span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was a point in my career when my leader cared enough to take me aside and told me,  &#8220;Shannon, you&#8217;re driving great results, but your team isn&#8217;t behind you.  You&#8217;re charging up the hill, but if you stopped to turn around and look, you&#8217;d see the team is still at the bottom. You need to slow down and bring your team along for the ride with you.&#8221;</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was pushing too hard toward a goal. I wasn&#8217;t appreciating how my team could help or connecting with them enough to instill trust and belief in my leadership and where I was taking us.  It&#8217;s a moment in my career I will never forget.  Your people are your greatest asset. That&#8217;s why being your authentic self is never a weakness. Authenticity is a strength that will pay dividends if you embrace it.</span></p>\r\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">     7. What have you learned on your supply chain journey so far, and what&#8217;s next?</span></h4>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;ve learned to trust myself more and remember that even if sometimes taking risks in my career doesn&#8217;t work out, the attempts themselves are critical opportunities for professional growth.  Stepping outside of your comfort zone and taking a leap can be uncomfortable, and failing isn&#8217;t pretty, but it&#8217;s what you do after the breakdown that matters most.   </span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the future, I want to continue working with leaders at companies that are pushing the boundaries on how technology can create transparent supply chains.</span></p>\r\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">    8. What advice do you have for girls and women looking to enter careers in transportation and logistics? </span></h4>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Embrace tackling challenges and learning new things that may feel uncomfortable at first. If trying something feels uncomfortable in the beginning, you&#8217;re probably learning! Network, network, and network—in my experience, people want to pay it forward and will be generous with their time.  You just need to ask.</span></p>\r\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">     9. What does being recognized in the Women In Supply Chain™ Series mean to you?</span></h4>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being featured is important to me because in Transportation and Logistics, even when you add technology and sales to that equation, there are very few women in the sector. As women, we bring meaningful diversity in thought with new solutions to the problems we&#8217;re facing across the supply chain. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Acting as a strong female role model to others looking to build a supply chain career is important to me. Visibility matters. Women need to see there are people like them succeeding in supply chain, bringing value, and advancing into leadership.  </span></p>\r\n<h2><b>Meet Our Sponsor</b></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This Women In Supply Chain™ feature was sponsored by Sifted.

    "web_content": "<p>As a loading dock safety specialist, I default to a holistic approach to workplace safety. It’s more than self-justification, it’s that I can’t come up with an answer to the question, “Which of a long list of rare but awful things are you ok with happening to your co-workers at your place of work?”</p>\n<p>For me the answer is, “None of them.”, and I look at every option to prevent workplace misery, workplace tragedy, and workplace disruption.</p>\n<h2>Dock 911</h2>\n<p>While keeping workers safe is reason enough to adopt a robust dock safety policy, it’s far from the only one. Almost any kind of accident at the loading dock is going to take a dock out of commission for some amount of time. And, as the gateway to the supply chain, an accident that takes a dock out of commission is going to be bad for business.</p>\n<p>Whether for attention to injury, investigation, paperwork, clean up, or repair, a closed dock comes with a cost. The supply chain can’t supply without entry and exit points.</p>\n<p>Even looking at several-year-old data, a loading dock closure has been shown to cost a company about $1700 per hour. And for serious accidents involving injury or major damage, the number can be significantly higher.</p>\n<p>The good news is, that a comprehensive dock-safety strategy can protect your people and your business.</p>\n<h2>Safety first, but safety where?</h2>\n<p>Because forklifts and falls account for a hefty percentage of loading dock accidents, safety strategies have largely focused on inside-the-dock prevention. Even things like trailer restraints and dock levelers are protecting workers and drivers during loading and offloading inside the trailer.</p>\n<p>However, it’s important to be aware that the area immediately outside the loading dock – the dock approach – is among the riskiest places for a worker to be. It’s not that the number of accidents is enormous, it’s that the nature of them tends to be dire.</p>\n<p>For workers outside, truck traffic at the loading dock is life-threatening. Big rigs, trying to stay on schedule, are coming and going and reversing into tight dock positions with big blind spots. It takes only a brief lapse of attention, from either driver or pedestrian, for an accident to occur.</p>\n<h2>No Boots on the Ground<sup>®</sup></h2>\n<p>There are legitimate reasons for a worker to be outside the loading dock. Still, the risk is enough of a concern that more and more businesses are adopting a policy requiring all vehicular traffic to come to a full stop when a worker is on the tarmac. The consequence, of course, is adding a delay to the already stressed movement of goods.</p>\n<p>Another approach, one that is both safe and efficient, is to adopt a No Boots on the Ground<sup>®</sup> policy in the loading dock area. Adopting strategies to eliminate foot traffic in the area requires some planning and technology, but removing a major source of risk is worthy of the effort.</p>\n<p>While trailer stands and supports are important safety precautions, they have typically required deployment by a worker at risk in the dock approach. New solutions like a stand/support that can be deployed by the shunt truck, or one that rises automatically into position with the push of a button, make a No Boots on Ground<sup>® </sup>environment possible.</p>\n<h2>Safety. It’s good for business.</h2>\n<p>Safety in business is good business. Protecting your people also protects the critical movement of goods and the supply chain itself. If it’s been a minute since your last safety audit, consider the benefits of a No Boots on the Ground<sup>®</sup> policy in your loading dock.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>About the Author</h2>\n<p><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-14676 alignleft\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Dirk-Headshot-Vanessa-Malus-300x214.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"214\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Dirk-Headshot-Vanessa-Malus-300x214.jpg 300w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Dirk-Headshot-Vanessa-Malus-1024x731.jpg 1024w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Dirk-Headshot-Vanessa-Malus-768x549.jpg 768w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Dirk-Headshot-Vanessa-Malus-1536x1097.jpg 1536w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Dirk-Headshot-Vanessa-Malus-2048x1463.jpg 2048w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Dirk-Headshot-Vanessa-Malus-600x429.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" />Dirk Seis is the Director of Marketing at <a href=\"https://idealwarehouse.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ideal Warehouse Innovations, Inc., an IDA Member Company and manufacturer of dock safety accessories</a>.

    "web_content": "<h5>By Nelson Holzner, CEO and Co-Founder of <a href=\"https://www.modifi.com/us\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">MODIFI</a></h5>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Inflation is sweeping the globe in a way not seen since the 1980s. This, coupled with other external factors like clogged ports, only continues to exacerbate the havoc that disrupts the global supply chain. Exporters now find themselves in a difficult position where they must balance gambling on increased credit risk from buyers, navigating slower logistics and remaining one step ahead of their competition by offering favorable payment terms. However, exporters can overcome some of these challenges by using financing solutions to improve cash flow, and significantly reduce the buyer’s payment risk.</p>\n<p>A decline in consumer demand caused by inflation and a decrease in consumer confidence is resulting in buyers taking more precautions to protect themselves when restocking inventory through trade. Multiple global factors, such as the ongoing war in Ukraine, continued COVID restrictions and unprecedented weather like rolling heat waves across the world, are contributing to the decline in buying power that consumers have, which is causing delays in inventory movement.</p>\n<h4>Reaction from Buyers</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.modifi.com/post/global-supply-chain-predictions-for-h2-2022\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">In reaction to current conditions</a>, buyers are becoming more conservative about the payment terms for their exporters. Whereas buyers previously would have been willing to pay cash up front or provide a Letter of Credit to the exporter, most buyers now request an open account or ask for longer payment terms in the 60-90 day range.</p>\n<p>Lenient payment terms are just one reactive measure buyers are taking in light of today’s global supply chain. Buyers are also causing a ripple with the length of time they are taking to pay – if they even pay at all. The Atradius Payment Practices Barometer &#8211; 2022 found that 42% of companies polled in the U.S. market reported devoting more resources to chasing unpaid debt compared to previous years. Typically, exporters could reduce this risk by requesting a Letter of Credit from the buyer, but the current market uncertainty has led to many buyers being unwilling or unable to do so.</p>\n<h4>Solutions for Exporters</h4>\n<p>Exporters can turn to financing to help maneuver the uncertain shifts happening in the supply chain and offer more enticing payment terms to buyers who currently have the upper hand in negotiations. As the certainty and timeliness of payments continue to decline, exporters can utilize financing to better manage their liquidity.</p>\n<p>With a plethora of financing solutions available, exporters should familiarize themselves with the pros and cons of each option when deciding which is best suited for their business. For example, revolving credit accounts such as credit cards, working capital loans from banks, and buy-now-pay-later are viable financing solutions. When deciding the best option for their business, exporters should consider the difference in cost of using lines of credit, as well as the time required to establish them.</p>\n<p>Since there are so many nuances, it can be challenging to compare the different types of financing solutions and land on just one. The best approach exporters can take is to adopt a combination of solutions that can be complimentary when implemented together. This strategic approach assists with maximizing available credit, and ultimately available cash, despite the turbulent market.</p>\n<h4>Digital Solutions to Scale and Manage Trade</h4>\n<p>It’s important to remember that “payment solutions” is an umbrella term and that financing is just one very important tool exporters can use. With MODIFI, exporters get paid instantly while the Buyers have the option to pay later..</p>\n<p>MODIFI’s business payment solutions for sellers enable businesses to amplify sales growth by offering more favorable payment terms to key accounts that nurture growth. In tandem, it strengthens relations with buyers by allowing longer payment terms, increasing volume and mitigating risk. Additionally, businesses will receive an expedited cash flow by getting paid on day one, rather than day 30-120, which can be used to fund business growth, even during uncertain times.</p>\n<p>Many of our clients have bank facilities but will add our solution as an add-on to their export business for multiple reasons. We fund deals banks typically reject, our non-debt solution provides an extra cushion of liquidity, and we’ll handle the collection directly if the buyer is late.</p>\n<p>MODIFI accomplishes this by conducting credit risk assessments on the buyer and insuring them, meaning if the buyer defaults the seller will still get paid. This drastically reduces the risk of fraud in thde transaction because MODIFI owns the invoice.</p>\n<p>MODIFI’s digital platform helps businesses of all sizes quickly scale and manage trades with no long-term contracts. Not only is it a hub to manage invoices, track shipments, and oversee the overall payment process, but it is an easy-to-implement solution that allows sellers to manage their liquidity, enabling them to do larger trades, handle supply chain uncertainty, and expand on trade by having the funds to operate and grow their business.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/episode-291-make-trade-easy-with-modifi\">Hear from Nelson as he chats he tells Sarah Barnes-Humphrey all about making trade simple.</a></h4>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xhH7fEnbpVQ\" width=\"640\" height=\"498\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<h1>About the Author</h1>\n<p><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-14528 alignleft\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Nelson-Holzner-CEO-MODIFI-1-Susana-Leiser-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Nelson-Holzner-on-Lets-Talk-Supply-Chain\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Nelson-Holzner-CEO-MODIFI-1-Susana-Leiser-300x200.jpg 300w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Nelson-Holzner-CEO-MODIFI-1-Susana-Leiser-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Nelson-Holzner-CEO-MODIFI-1-Susana-Leiser-768x512.jpg 768w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Nelson-Holzner-CEO-MODIFI-1-Susana-Leiser-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Nelson-Holzner-CEO-MODIFI-1-Susana-Leiser-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Nelson-Holzner-CEO-MODIFI-1-Susana-Leiser-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" />Nelson is currently the CEO and Co-Founder of MODIFI, a global fintech company that enables global commerce through a platform for business payments and trade management software.

With respect to robot mobility, for example, these decision-based actions include, but are not limited to, basic tasks like starting, stopping, and maneuvering around obstacles that are in their way.</p>\n<p>Before discussing what truly makes a robot autonomous, let’s discuss one of the most common misconceptions surrounding mobile robots today.</p>\n<h3>What are Autonomous Robots?</h3>\n<p>True autonomous robots are intelligent machines that can perform tasks and operate in an environment independently, without human control or intervention. This level of autonomy gives the workforce the ability to delegate dull, dangerous, or dirty tasks to the robot so humans can spend more time doing the interesting, engaging, and valuable parts of their job.</p>\n<p>For the last 15-20 years, the popular use of robotics has largely involved tele-operated mobile robots equipped with cameras being used to get eyes on something out of reach, or extremely simple industrial or warehouse applications. For example, not only are Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) being used to move materials in factories and warehouses, but flying robots (aka drones) are being used for disaster response, and underwater robots are being used to search and discover shipwrecks in the deepest depths of our oceans. While this use of robots has proven incredibly effective over the years, these examples in no way represent the use of truly autonomous robots.</p>\n<p>The term “robot” has been utilized repeatedly through the years by companies that want their customers to think their product is some sort of sophisticated Artificial Intelligence (AI). Additionally, the true definition of an autonomous robot has also been oversimplified and often used interchangeably with what amounts to pre-programmed machines—not to mention automated actuators like robotic arms or motion control systems.</p>\n<h3>The Worst Example of a (Not Really) Autonomous Robot</h3>\n<p>Quite frequently, the classic industrial machines you see in an assembly line for a car manufacturer are mislabeled as robots. While they are amazing feats of engineering, they are not robots at all and are instead like milling machines that operate off computer numerical controls (CNC).</p>\n<p>Unlike a truly autonomous robot, these industrial machines are pre-programmed to perform a repetitive movement. They are not able to react. For example, what would happen if one of these so-called robots responsible for installing spare tires in the trunk of a car encountered a random situation in which the trunk was shut. Would the “robot” know not to install the tire? Probably not. Instead, this machine would continue to perform its programmed task and would most likely end up smashing the tire right through the trunk lid. If this machine was truly an autonomous robot, then it would know not to install the tire based on the information it gathered from perceiving the situation and knowing that the trunk was not in fact open.</p>\n<h3>Why the Roomba is a Real Autonomous Robot</h3>\n<p>To fully understand autonomous mobile robots, it helps to see them in action. And one of the most well-known, and arguably most prolific, truly autonomous robot on the market today is the Roomba. While the Roomba is a consumer product, its capabilities and functionality translate to the warehouse and industrial space and have made AMRs a much more widely accessible technology.</p>\n<p>The Roomba can make decisions and act based on what it perceives in its environment. It can be placed in a room, left alone, and it will do its job without any help or supervision from a person.</p>\n<p>A set of sensors allows the Roomba to perceive its environment, decide a course of action based on these perceptions, and then take that appropriate action. The same concepts apply to warehouse robots — if an AMR encounters an obstacle (like a pallet) while it is performing set tasks on the warehouse floor, it will navigate around the issue and continue without human interference.</p>\n<p>Simply put, an autonomous robot is one that decides the action it should take on its own based on information it has perceived. If you would like to learn more about autonomous robots or their endless possible applications, contact us today. If you are not sure how an autonomous mobile robot might be helpful to you, here are 8 great examples.</p>\n<h3>8 Applications of Autonomous Robots</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>AMRs for Logistics</h4>\n<p>While the capabilities of AMRs continue to advance, the most basic and widely used application for these machines is for material transport. AMRs can transport orders across a warehouse or through a shipping facility countless times a day. Transport is a labor-intensive job and utilizing robots for these tasks is one of the easiest ways to free up human workers for more important jobs without disrupting workflows.</p>\n<h4>AMRs for E-Commerce</h4>\n<p>AMRs for e-commerce applications can come in many forms, from moving carts to mobile manipulation and more. Because AMR platforms can include multiple accessories, their flexibility makes them ideal for a number of applications, even within specific applications like transport and sortation.</p>\n<p>Today we see AMRs utilized in tasks like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Order fulfillment<br />\nReturns handling<br />\nRaw materials transport and sorting<br />\nParcel sortation<br />\nInventory management<br />\nAMRs for Warehousing<br />\nWarehouses and distribution centers today are massive, with some spanning more than 1 million square feet. When AMRs are utilized in warehousing applications, they are best suited to do the heavy lifting and transport of goods throughout the space. Tasking AMRs with basic warehousing ops reduces the time workers spend traveling in a warehouse, allowing them to work on more value-added tasks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One feature of note for AMRs is their ability to “see” and localize in open spaces. AMRs use lasers to scan their environment and their embedded systems analyze the sensor data, enabling them to see obstacles and navigate safely. However, enormous warehouses lack the walls, posts, and other fixed features that many AMRs need to effectively navigate. This environment requires an AMR that has a navigation system specifically designed for warehouse operation.</p>\n<p>Another important task in warehousing and distribution is palletizing, a monotonous, repetitive process that is well suited for automation. To speed up this task and empower workers to do other jobs, AMRs are now being applied to palletizing. With AMR platforms, lift plates, and robotic arms, palletizing can be almost completely automated. Palletizing robots can complete every step of the process – loading, transport, and unloading – autonomously, efficiently, and accurately.</p>\n<h3>AMRs and Mobile Manipulators for Manufacturing</h3>\n<p>The versatility of AMRs makes them ideal for the ever-changing, dynamic world of manufacturing. AMRs that are designed to be easily set up and used by workers within existing factories allow companies of any size to leverage AMRs’ capabilities for an endless variety of tasks.</p>\n<p>Beyond transporting in-process parts and finished goods, AMRs integrated with accessories such as conveyors or robotic arms, can assist in the production process. For example, AMRs with robotic arms can sort, pick, and pack products with the added ability to dynamically move to multiple locations.</p>\n<p>Static conveyors have long been used in line work, as they help speed up production and sorting. Adding a conveyor onto an AMR means that conveyor capabilities can now be flexible and mobile. AMRs with built-in conveyors can connect to static conveyors to move products more effectively throughout a facility.</p>\n<p>AMRs with attachments that can lift loads and connect to carts allow the robots to load and unload payloads and, in some cases, connect to carts without human intervention. This combination of the cart transport and loading/unloading in one AMR is a relatively new capability, but one that will create more potential applications for autonomous robots.</p>\n<h4>AMRs for Data Centers</h4>\n<p>Secure autonomous transport is an integral part of operations at data centers and research facilities, which has created a new application for AMRs. Autonomous robots outfitted with lock boxes and cabinets can be used to safely transport high value materials and ensure that the proper chain of custody protocol is followed. This also enables instant, accurate, and easily accessible documentation of the process.</p>\n<h4>AMRs in Healthcare</h4>\n<p>As the capabilities and ease-of-use improves for AMRs, many industries are finding innovative applications for robots. Today we are seeing more autonomous robots being utilized in the healthcare field for a variety of tasks.</p>\n<p>First and foremost, AMRs are a useful tool to streamline transport of supplies and medicine throughout a healthcare facility. This is even more important in infectious disease units as it prevents nurses from coming into frequent contact with potential contaminants, but still ensures that patients receive proper treatment. Secondly, medical AMRs can also be used in sanitation—robots can be outfitted with virus-killing UV lights or decontamination sprays that clean up a room or space without exposing people to potential harm.</p>\n<h4>AMRs in Biotech</h4>\n<p>While facing a fast-growing market for biopharmaceuticals, biotech companies need to comply with strongly regulated production processes, which can mean labor-intensive tasks. For example, sampling and maintenance of cell culture processes are labor-intensive and require constant monitoring on a 24/7 basis. Autonomous mobile robots combined with robotic arms can be used to control valuable process inputs, perform regular monitoring tasks, and safely manage waste removal from the production line.</p>\n<p>With AMRs handling the repetitive tasks, workers can focus on critical steps in the biopharmaceutical manufacturing process such as tracking of growth parameters, continuous testing, and making necessary adjustments as development progresses.</p>\n<h4>AMRs for Research and Development</h4>\n<p>For research and development, AMRs are used to minimize tedious transport tasks involved in repetitive testing or other engineering requirements. In addition, AMRs are increasingly becoming a part of the research itself.</p>\n<p>For example, one hot area of innovation is the development of sensors and robotic manipulation technology. As these studies advance, researchers are looking for ways to mobilize the technology, but many organizations don’t have the time or funding to build their own platforms. With a flexible AMR, the sensors and manipulators used for research can be easily integrated into the mobile platform, providing easy to use, autonomous mobility to these developing technologies and saving companies and research institutions considerable time and money in the development process.</p>\n<h3>Crucial Components of an Autonomous Robot</h3>\n<p>The key components to the autonomous action mentioned above include these three key concepts: perception, decision, and actuation.</p>\n<h4>Perception</h4>\n<p>For people, perception is almost entirely performed by our five senses. Eyes, ears, skin, hair, and many other biological mechanisms are used to perceive the world. For a robot, perception means sensors. Laser scanners, stereo vision cameras (eyes), bump sensors (skin and hair), force-torque sensors (muscle strain), and even spectrometers (smell) are used as input devices for a robot to help it “see” and perceive its environment. And with both people and robots alike, we can now think of other kinds of information inputs, like the endless supply of data from the internet; in fact, one might think of the Internet of Things as an endless sea of sensors with very long wires reaching back to the robots that might use them.</p>\n<h4>Decision</h4>\n<p>For humans, it’s our brain that makes most of our decisions; or in some cases our “gut” or even our neural system. Our brains make higher level decisions, like where we want to walk, for example. But sometimes our biology supersedes our brains, and our bodies react to things before our brains even know what’s happening. Those reflexive behaviors, like eyelids closing to block a flying piece of debris, are operating faster and without the permission of our brains for the purpose of keeping us safe.</p>\n<p>Autonomous robots have a similar decision-making structure. The “brain” of a robot is usually a computer, and it makes decisions based on what its mission is and what information it receives along the way. But robots also have a capability that is like the neurological system in humans, where their safety systems operate faster and without the permission of the brain; in fact, in robots, the brain operates with the permission of the safety system. In an autonomous robot, we call that “neurological” system an embedded system; it operates faster and with higher authority than the computer that is executing a mission plan and parsing data. This is how the robot can decide to stop if it notices an obstacle in its way, if it detects a problem with itself, or if its emergency-stop button is pressed.</p>\n<h4>Actuation</h4>\n<p>People have actuators called muscles. They come in all kinds of shapes and perform all kinds of functions, from grabbing a cup of coffee to beating our hearts and pumping blood. Robots can have all kinds of actuators, too, and a motor of some kind is usually at the heart of the actuator. Whether it’s a wheel, linear actuator, or hydraulic ram, there’s always a motor converting energy into movement.</p>\n<p>Our full fleet of autonomous mobile robots have perception (through their LiDAR and vision technology); decision-making; and actuation in the form of wheels. They are able to work in any part of your warehouse and move material around the warehouse, eliminating unproductive walking time for humans to significantly improve productivity and lower cycle times.</p>\n<h1><strong>About the Author</strong></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-14498 alignleft\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Jason-Walker-Mary-Hart.webp\" alt=\"Jason Walker from Locus Robotics on Let&#039;s Talk Supply Chain™.\" width=\"244\" height=\"244\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Jason-Walker-Mary-Hart.webp 244w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Jason-Walker-Mary-Hart-150x150.webp 150w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Jason-Walker-Mary-Hart-100x100.webp 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 244px) 100vw, 244px\" />Jason has over 20 years of robotics leadership roles that range from managing QA and testing for iRobot’s Roomba to co-founding CyPhy Works, a revolutionary tethered drone company.

    "web_content": "<p>This tale of black holes isn’t science fiction; it’s the story of a real distributor who blasted off from an antiquated system of 12 physical clipboards on a wall to create a command-and-control center on a smartphone.</p>\n<h3><strong>The results? Out of this world.</strong></h3>\n<p>Pete first shared his story with me when I was considering coming aboard Cavallo as CEO. I wanted to explore the actual daily lives of the company’s customers.</p>\n<p>When I evaluate companies I want to work with, I start with <strong>two basic questions:</strong> “Does this company create tremendous value in ways that are deeply important to the end customer?” And, “Does it scale?” (As a data nerd, I consider “tremendous value” to be statistically significant growth by tenfold or more. If I don’t feel connected to real value creation, I’m not interested.)</p>\n<p><strong>Pete Eardley wasn’t just the guy who’d ultimately hire me.</strong> He was also Cavallo Customer #1, someone who had grown his own wholesale distribution business into a resilient, hyper-competitive, and wildly profitable mid-market success.</p>\n<p>That meant he was the first person whose story I needed to hear if I wanted to understand a day in the life of a Cavallo user. Pete’s tale would be validated time and again by customers I spoke with: Despite its rewards, managing a small to mid-size distribution business was a daily exercise in firefighting.</p>\n<p>During that first conversation, Pete told me how he did his best to “control the controllables” by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Hiring</b> good employees,</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Training</b> them to a standard, and</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Trusting</b> that they performed to spec in managing every line item of every order, every time — from quoting a customer to the collection of cash.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In other words, he’d assembled a great crew to propel his business forward. The challenge was to give them the controls they needed to spot black holes in time to steer clear of them.</p>\n<p>Pete’s own view from the command deck was less than stellar: Over days and weeks, his metrics were limited to “orders in” and “shipments out.” (He later acknowledged he wasn’t sure he even knew those figures with confidence on a daily basis.) While he was pleased with the general growth trend, Pete believed he could do a lot better.</p>\n<p>Like many businesses, Pete would only get the full picture of his profitability and other financial measures after the accounting period — several days into the next month. That lag made it difficult to get ahead of issues, maximize profitability, and drive continuous improvement. (Never mind the impact on Pete’s fishing, hunting, and golf plans!)</p>\n<h2><strong>Out of the black hole</strong></h2>\n<p>Like other top-performing business leaders, Pete was so averse to waste and inefficiency, leaving them unresolved was never an option. He could sense an unproductive process a mile away. He also knew his ERP system alone was not designed to deliver the visibility, control, and insights he needed.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t that his ERP was deficient. It simply wasn’t designed to meet his outsize vision of the future — one in which he’d know with certainty that every order would land in the “perfect order” slot. Most ERP systems are generalist tools; they support common enterprise-wide data and business processes, and they deliver required financial accounting and reporting capabilities. They’re <i>not</i> designed to meet industry verticals’ specific and stringent requirements.</p>\n<p>Escaping information black holes profitably and at scale requires technology. Pete’s precise vision, combined with a lack of patience for a lengthy software selection process, led him to build his own solution … now almost two decades ago.</p>\n<p><strong>The results were world-beating.</strong> In his last two fiscal years before selling his distribution company to private equity, return on assets exceeded 90%; revenue per head was two times the industry benchmark; and days sales outstanding (DSO) was cut in half.</p>\n<p>One business rule alone enabled Pete to capture more than <em>$300,000 in incremental profit per year</em>. Essentially, this one pricing rule prevented “leaking” cost-of-goods-sold (COGS) improvements through pricing decisions made by the sales team. Therefore, every cent of COGS improvement that he wanted to preserve dropped straight to the bottom line.</p>\n<p><strong>The rest is history:</strong> After seeing the results within his own shop, Pete would ultimately market his in-house software solution as commercial software known as Cavallo (formerly SalesPad).</p>\n<p>Cavallo helped other companies as much as it had helped Pete’s. With the right technology in place, leaders can set and forget their entire order management process, confident that every order is handled precisely the way they want. They can advance from chaos to control.</p>\n<p>Trading firefighting for control lets business leaders make significantly more money. It also helps them sleep better at night without wondering what could go wrong — or if they’ll even realize it when it happens.</p>\n<p>Control over his operations reduced Pete’s typical work week to 20 or 25 hours. His wife would ask him at the start of his weekdays, “Are you fishing, hunting, playing golf, or working today?” Via his smartphone, Pete retained control over the dials in his business whether he was on the ninth hole or a fishing boat on the Atlantic Ocean.</p>\n<h2><strong>Spotting black holes in <em>your</em> operation</strong></h2>\n<p>You can achieve similar results at a cost that can deliver substantial ROI — but first, you need to know where in your operation to look. With that end in mind, start with an honest assessment of where you are today.</p>\n<p>We’ve talked to many business owners and decision-makers who believed their day-to-day chaos was just part of wholesale distribution. It’s eye-opening and refreshing to realize that there is a better way.</p>\n<p><strong>The first step to navigating your enterprise’s own black holes:</strong> an honest and thorough assessment of your current situation.</p>\n<ol>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Do I have complete command over all of my processes? </b>Analyze each process and grade it as a Strength, Moderate Gap, or Significant Gap.  Using Lean 6 Sigma waste types can be a helpful perspective: Defects, Overproduction, Waiting, Non-Utilized Talent, Transportation, Inventory, Motion, and Excess Processing.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Can your problem or pain point stand up to the  </b><a href=\"https://sixsigmastudyguide.com/5-whys/#:~:text=The%205%20Whys%20is%20a,cause%20and%20then%20eliminating%20it.\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><b>“5 Whys”</b></a><b>?</b> This technique was developed by Toyota Industries in the 1930’s and used by many firms since.

    "title": "A New Cloud EDI Platform: 5 Ways to Simplify EDI",

    "web_content": "<p>For many companies, implementing EDI and onboarding trading partners is a time-consuming, costly, and frustrating process. Traditional EDI software integrations and partner onboarding have not evolved over the years. If you’ve accumulated EDI connections with hundreds of trading partners, the thought of switching platforms may seem daunting. A growing number of companies are learning that there are new solutions with modern architectures available that make EDI much simpler to manage, maintain and scale. They warrant a closer look.</p>\n<p>Orderful is one of these new solutions. Built as a <a href=\"https://www.orderful.com/product/cloud-edi-platform/?utm_source=LTSC&amp;utm_medium=Referral&amp;utm_campaign=SYN-22-q3-Let&#039;s-Talk-Supply-Chain&amp;utm_term=cloud-edi\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cloud EDI platform</a> that eliminates the most common problems and hassles associated with building and maintaining EDI connections, here are five ways Orderful has simplified the day-to-day management of EDI.</p>\n<h4><strong>1. It starts with offering a modern API. </strong></h4>\n<p>Until now, if you wanted to connect your business systems to EDI software, you were looking at writing a custom interface, often in the programming language of the business system. The custom interface would often need to be modified to accommodate each new trading partner’s specific EDI requirements. Resulting in maintaining a lot of custom code in multiple languages.</p>\n<p>With the Orderful cloud EDI platform, your developers code to simple RESTful APIs to integrate your enterprise applications to Orderful. You can also utilize any iPaaS, middleware, or any programming language to connect your business system to Orderful’s API. This may not sound like such a big deal. But for EDI software, this is quite unique and long overdue. Your team does not need to know X12 or EDIFACT as the Orderful platform leverages JSON. Orderful validates and converts your JSON data into the formats that each of your trading partners require.</p>\n<p>This means any developer can service EDI. Given how hard it is to find experienced EDI developers, this can save extensive time and reduce a lot of costs for your business.</p>\n<h4><strong>2. Integrate once and simplify integration by consolidating trading partner requirements. </strong></h4>\n<p>Gathering and managing EDI transactions specifications from dozens of trading partners can be painful. For example, some partners require 3 documents, other partners require 5 documents, and you have to manage all the nuances of what one partner expects in an 850 versus another.</p>\n<p>Orderful will digitize all of these requirements for you. It will also allow you to build one integration with the API per transaction type (i.e. 850). You send a single payload for that transaction and Orderful will do the mapping and validation to each trading partner&#8217;s unique requirements.</p>\n<p>Orderful provides an integration assistance that allows your team to visually see the data you sent and the mapping to the proper EDI requirements. You can then make any final changes using the point and click business rules engine (i.e. always send Box instead of BX) to handle the minor requirements without requiring a developer to make code changes.</p>\n<h4><strong>3. More than 2,500 pre-integrated EDI network trading partners. </strong></h4>\n<p>Orderful has built <a href=\"https://www.orderful.com/edi-trading-partner-network/?utm_source=LTSC&amp;utm_medium=Referral&amp;utm_campaign=SYN-22-q3-Let&#039;s-Talk-Supply-Chain&amp;utm_term=network\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a network of 2,500 pre-integrated trading partners.</a> This enables you to dramatically reduce your time spent on EDI. Orderful does the heavy lifting by keeping up with the trading partner’s ever-changing requirements, freeing your team for more important tasks. Once connected to Orderful’s platform, you can start testing and trading within a week or less.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Orderful publishes digital EDI guidelines for each trading partner in the network, and uses these EDI requirements to do real-time automated EDI data validation. This validation removes the traditional feedback loop problems of EDI. Orderful also provides pre-configured connections for each trading partner in the network using major channels such as AS2, HTTP/S, SFTP/FTP, Poller, and VAN.</p>\n<h4><strong>4. Reduce costs by eliminating EDI chargebacks and integration errors. </strong></h4>\n<p>EDI chargebacks are financial penalties imposed by trading partners for EDI transactions that don’t comply with a trading partner’s requirements. These chargebacks can add up quickly and cut into your already thin margins with your trading partners. Orderful streamlines your testing and validation processes so you can make sure a new EDI transaction is going to be accepted by the new trading partner. Testing scenarios are published for each trading partner in the network and include requirements that will guide you through the testing process with each partner.</p>\n<p>But perhaps the biggest time-saver Orderful offers for the testing process is the rules capability. Rather than hiring pricey EDI consultants, or waiting for an EDI developer to become available, your business analysts can write EDI rules using the point and click interface, and can easily modify transactions without needing a developer to modify code.</p>\n<h4><strong>5. Onboard new EDI trading partners 80% faster. </strong></h4>\n<p>No one wants EDI onboarding to be difficult. However, there are challenges of collecting requirements, coding new interfaces, and prioritizing other tasksall with limited resources. Unfortunately, this has led to the industry standard for new EDI onboarding of 6-8 weeks.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.orderful.com/our-stories/customer-stories/?utm_source=LTSC&amp;utm_medium=Referral&amp;utm_campaign=SYN-22-q3-Let&#039;s-Talk-Supply-Chain&amp;utm_term=customer-stories\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Orderful customers</a> are onboarding new trading partners in days, not months.

    "web_content": "<p>In 2005 I came across a book, Sense &amp; Respond (The Journey to Customer Purpose) Creating and Leading Sense-And-Respond Organizations.</p>\n<p>I was sitting on the train, on my way to a client site in Switzerland at the time (leading a global project working in Deloitte &amp; Touch) and I came across this paragraph: “A sense-and-respond organization does not attempt to predict future demand for its offerings. Instead, it identifies changing customer needs and new business challenges as they happen, responding to them quickly and appropriately before these new opportunities disappear or metamorphose into something else. Adaptability has come to be increasingly valued in recent years, and the terms flexibility, agility, and responsiveness crop up frequently in business discussions today.”</p>\n<p>As I was sitting at the train my brain started to explode, I was looking through the window at the view and thought, I am going to change my path. I have then taken the decision to move from IT (ERP &amp; CRM mainly) career path to Supply Chain journey, I was excited by the evolution of the WWW and could only imagine what impact it will lead to the supply chain, 20 years later I am sure that at that point I did not grasp the full evolution.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to 2021, Gartner published an article “Cultivate Next-Generation Sensing Capabilities” they are referring to the supply chain ability to better Sense &amp; Respond in real time to generate value across the organization.</p>\n<p>“A key focus is the ability to sense environmental changes through data-driven insights, thus enabling a more agile and swift response. To achieve this, many supply chains are turning to control tower capabilities that leverage structured and unstructured data from across the end-to-end supply chain, as well as data from the public domain and/or social media (for example, risk, weather, economic or syndicated data).</p>\n<p>However, while any company with a supply chain across virtually any industry can use supply chain control-tower-type capabilities, the term “control tower” still means many different things to many people. This creates a recipe for confusion within businesses and more broadly in the marketplace.</p>\n<p>Gartner defines a “control tower” as a concept combining five elements — people, process, data, and organization, supported by a set of technology-enabled capabilities for transparency and coordination. The potential span of responsibility for a supply chain. At the article published today they have written “Sense and Respond in Real Time: The Continued Growth and Investment in Control Towers.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://unilog.company/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unilog</a> is doing what I was hardly able to imagine back in 2005, yet I had a clear vision that it should combine people, process and technology. Performance in motion, this is how we Sense &amp; Respond in real-time.</p>\n<p>The term “Sense &amp; Respond” was coined by Alan Hohne at Australia’s Westpac Bank in the early 1990s, and was first published in a 1992 Management Review article by Stephan H. Haeckel. At that point, it was not much more than a description of characteristics large organizations would need in order to survive in a climate of unpredictable change. Over the next several years Haeckel elaborated the term into a comprehensive set of managerial concepts and prescriptions. These were the foundation of articles and Executive Education classes taught at IBM’s Advanced Business Institute in the 1990s, and of the book Adaptive Enterprise: Creating and Leading Sense-and-Respond Organizations, published by Harvard Business School Press in 1999.</p>\n<div class=\"Qr7Oae\" role=\"listitem\">\n<div class=\"OxAavc\" data-required=\"true\" data-input=\"L9xHkb\" data-item-id=\"1609135432\">\n<div class=\"pYfr3c\">\n<div class=\"prOLdf\">\n<div class=\"g53bl\">\n<h4><a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/episode279-global-supply-chain/\">Hear from Unilog as they chat with Sarah Barnes-Humphrey about designing and managing global supply chains.</a></h4>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"pYfr3c\">\n<div class=\"prOLdf\">\n<div class=\"g53bl\">\n<div id=\"c264\" class=\"cTDvob D1wxyf\" role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" aria-describedby=\"i.desc.1609135432 c268\">\n<h1><img decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-14134 aligncenter\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Osi-limor-koren-300x75.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"408\" height=\"102\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Osi-limor-koren-300x75.jpg 300w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Osi-limor-koren-1024x256.jpg 1024w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Osi-limor-koren-768x192.jpg 768w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Osi-limor-koren-600x150.jpg 600w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Osi-limor-koren.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px\" /></h1>\n<h1></h1>\n<h1><strong>About the Author</strong></h1>\n<p>Osi heads up the Unilog team and describes herself as a lifelong learner. “I love being part of the Unilog team, whom I have the privilege to meet every day.

    "web_content": "<p>Many shippers have found it’s nearly impossible to track and manage their allocation efficiently today. The reason they struggle to manage their allocation is often due to inadequate workflows and booking rules, along with relying on the outdated legacy systems they use to manage it.</p>\n<p>In this article, we’ll highlight three reasons shippers struggle to manage their allocation and how harmonized contract performance and forecasting can enable <a href=\"https://nyshex.com/4-ways-to-optimize-allocation-and-reduce-the-cost-of-non-performance/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">optimized allocation</a>.</p>\n<h2>1. Shippers Lack Interconnectivity Across Systems</h2>\n<p>Many problems in logistics derive from poor communication and sharing of information across systems. In today’s digital world, there is a system for everything and each function. That works fine in simple, one- or two-person interactions, but the typical shipment may have dozens of touchpoints, scores of data triggers, and an endless supply of information associated with each shipment. This amounts to an inability to correctly connect your POs, forecasts, and carrier allocation.</p>\n<p>For example, if a carrier sends a large CSV file with estimated sailings and rolled container statuses once or twice per week, that data still requires re-entry into another system, which is done via Excel in many cases. That can drain hours of manual work from your team and add the risk of error.</p>\n<p>As such, your forecasts are constantly playing catch-up with outdated data while today’s advanced systems make things operate more efficiently and in near-real-time.</p>\n<h2>2. Data Is Static &amp; Unorganized</h2>\n<p>Managing data in Excel sounded great, 10 or 15 years ago. However, it’s simply inefficient, overwhelming, and risky in today’s age. By the time shippers and BCOs receive data, its value begins to decline. By the time they enter the data into spreadsheets and decide their forecasted demand, the data is too old to have a meaningful impact.</p>\n<p>Most shippers forecast allocation on a four-week cycle. Yes, that cycle might be extended during high-activity periods, such as the holiday shipping season, but updating the data weekly leaves massive room for error in managing contracts. Furthermore, this manual method of managing data carries the labor cost of transcription and updating.</p>\n<p>Still, what’s the other part of the process that breaks down? To answer that question, shippers need to hone in on process standardization.</p>\n<h2>3. Lack of Process Standardization Leads to Misallocated Freight</h2>\n<p>Today’s carriers have different contract terms, definitions for what things mean, and different penalty or cost structures. While service contracts help to set some standards, the simple reality is that carriers are separate entities, and their processes can vary widely.

This new delivery space has emerged in response to convenience culture – consumer expectations for rapid, inexpensive and predictable deliveries. We hear from retailers and logistics providers that they are actively decentralizing their supply chain, or planning to, in an effort to store goods closer to the consumer, all to enable faster deliveries and greater fulfillment optionality. This trend has created urban middle-mile use cases – such as warehouse-to-micro-fulfillment-center deliveries and store-to-store inventory rebalances – at a time when the supply chain is already stretched.</p>\n<p>Autonomous vehicles (AVs) could play a key role in shaping the urban middle-mile. Here’s how:</p>\n<p><strong>Deploy AVs on-demand across urban middle-mile routes to enable faster deliveries.</strong></p>\n<p>The emergence of urban middle-mile deliveries can add logistical complexities, introducing more routes and on-demand dispatching requirements. Many retailers and logistics companies are feeling the impact of driver shortages. More than one-third of shipping companies <a href=\"https://eliteextra.com/driver-shortage-the-monster-facing-last-mile-delivery#:~:text=Over%2037%25%20of%20last%2Dmile,their%20products%20to%20be%20delivered.\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> that their biggest problem is finding qualified drivers, which impacts costs for both shippers and customers. Some retailers are pulling associates off sales floors to drive products to other stores, yet this clearly isn’t sustainable. Instead, as businesses decentralize their inventory to enable faster delivery times, AVs can be deployed on-demand to fulfill customer needs without disrupting business operations. Automating the repetitive urban middle-mile routes could allow businesses to scale their delivery operations to meet rising demand.</p>\n<p><strong>Surface actionable data insights to plan, predict and optimize urban middle-mile logistics.</strong></p>\n<p>As companies explore urban middle-mile deliveries, data insights could enable them to optimize overall fleet performance and utilization. Current and potential customers say that they often lack clarity about where their products are when they leave one facility and before they arrive at the next, and that they rarely have actionable insight into the root cause of delivery delays or missed delivery windows. The urban middle-mile requires greater logistics flexibility, and to enable this, businesses will need transparency to both predict and respond to disruptions. Our autonomous, connected vehicles generate precise positioning data and delivery status updates, providing businesses with real-time information, as well as historic averages and trends, to optimize delivery schedules, maintain adequate inventory levels, plan efficient routes, and more.</p>\n<p>Argo’s autonomous vehicles operating on urban middle-mile routes can enable retailers and logistics providers to meet the emerging fulfillment demands of their customers.

Recent studies from BCG, BAIN, Mc Kinsey and others on success rates of digital transformations state that only 30% or even less of transformations succeed in achieving their objectives.</p>\n<p>What you can hear everywhere is that “adoption” is a big concern, if not already a problem. Since the effectiveness of digitalization is the product of technical enablement times adoption, the focus starts to shift. Digital adoption gets into focus to make investments in technology effective and sustainably leverage process transformation.</p>\n<p>“I expect Google and Amazon to be a disruptive distributor in our market soon. If we cannot answer their request in seconds, they will ping the next competitor. This means our entire information chain needs to be digitally integrated in a seamless way. This is very different from having a prominent e2e planning system implemented and the people bypassing it with their excel spreadsheets!” a CSCO in life science recently said to me. This hits the nail!</p>\n<h1>So, what is the challenge with “digital adoption”?</h1>\n<p>Digitalization changes the operational way of working fundamentally, not just incrementally! We are typically talking about new workflows where former sequential steps get consolidated and integrated, new responsibilities, new collaborations, new supporting functionality with much more supporting logic. Digitalization enforces a higher level of integration, less room for manual intervention, corrections, and amendments. The missing master data is a problem in the integrated world, while the less integrated was more tolerant since the missing information got augmented in the local excel sheet. And the high level of integration creates interdependency across the process: like a gear depends on all gearwheels doing their job in interplay, the rule “all or none” also applies to digitally integrated processes.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, people – we all! &#8211; tend to retain our habitual way of working! We do it by nature. This is what we call “The force of habit”. We all have our long-practiced routines, procedures, automatisms, tools, and collaborations. Applying these – especially under pressure – is a question of speed and efficiency, also the feeling of controllability.</p>\n<p>And when it comes to change in our domains, we often subconsciously also defend our domain. People typically find solid rational reasons, but the emotional part is the subsurface part of the iceberg.</p>\n<p>Consequently, workflows often remain “tribal”. That means the digitalized to-be way of working gets just partially adopted, habitual ways are retained and the “local EXCEL sheet” – the most obvious symptom of tribal workflows – survive. Often even adherence KPIs get cheated. People know for example that their sign-in into the new system is monitored. So, they sign in before they open Excel, simple.</p>\n<p>The result is quite disastrous: Tribal elements neutralize any effect of digitalization. The investment gains suboptimal return if any. Digitalization remains superficial without real transformation. This is what the title of my upcoming book expresses a bit more drastically: “Tribal f*cks up Digital”.</p>\n<p>An experience that many organizations have painfully made is that digital transformation is much more than implementing digital technology. Throwing technology at vaguely known business processes is a waste of money and energy.</p>\n<p>Don’t underestimate that your as-is processes are already “tribal” today. That means that the workflows do not necessarily correspond with your process description or the expected way.</p>\n<p>Anyway: level 3 is by far not detailed enough, neither for as-is understanding nor for to-be!</p>\n<p>Do you doubt that your digital adoption is sufficient and want to get more from your investment? Or you are approaching a digital transformation project and want to avoid the pitfalls that neutralize effectiveness?

    "web_content": "<h2>Price Stabilization, Legislation, And The Shift Towards ESG</h2>\n<p>The disruption the global supply chain is facing today has been a long time coming, yet it seems to have caught the entire industry off guard. Despite over a decade of investment in final mile operations (the final stages of the supply chain), stagnation in innovation across the first mile has been dramatically exposed by the sudden shock and ripple effects felt around the world from the fallout of the global pandemic.</p>\n<p>To compound matters even further, a shifting consumer and regulatory landscape is adding to the complexities. At the time of this article going live, I can imagine a lot of scrambling going on across importers up and down the country—and we’ve not even hit peak selling season yet.</p>\n<p>The past few years have been rife with turmoil and uncertainty. For many businesses reliant on importing their products thousands of miles across the sea and sky, there have been some valuable (and hard) lessons learned. Markets that were considered untouchable two years ago have been rocked by consumer demand that arose just as supply-side networks were thrown into flux due to Covid-19.</p>\n<p>The good news is that we’re starting to see some light at the end of the tunnel. Markets are beginning to stabilize as consumer demand decreases due to shrinking disposable income, alongside shipping costs decreasing in tandem with ports reopening.</p>\n<p><strong>Legislation leads the way</strong></p>\n<p>It appears that change isn’t over, however, as Congress recently announced a series of new measures to tackle some of the more politically tricky topics. For example, the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) which came into force on June 21st requires companies sending goods to the United States to scrutinize the supply chains in an attempt to bar imports of goods made “in whole or in part” in Xinjiang—unless of course, companies can prove their products were not made with forced labor.</p>\n<p>The bill also targets so-called “poverty alleviation” and pairing programs that ship people (the majority of Muslim faith) from impoverished areas to work in factories elsewhere, which human rights groups say are often coercive. Companies would be required to disclose information on their ties to Xinjiang to the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>\n<p>Xinjiang produces vast amounts of raw materials like cotton, coal, sugar, tomatoes, and polysilicon, and the city supplies workers for China’s apparel and footwear factories. Human rights groups and news reports have linked many multinational companies to suppliers there. Some reports tie Coca-Cola to sugar sourced from Xinjiang and also document Uyghur workers in a factory that makes Nike shoes in Qingdao. Brands like Coca-Cola and Nike will now have to spend a vast amount of money scrutinizing their supply chains and potentially finding new suppliers.</p>\n<p><strong>It’s time for a plan</strong></p>\n<p>Thankfully, importers aren’t on their own. Mercado Labs has recently announced the release of <a href=\"https://mercadolabs.com/plan\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mercado Plan</a>: a transformative technology designed to increase transparency by seamlessly connecting importers with their suppliers and partners to verify, educate, and inform them, and ensure they meet business-critical compliance and regulatory standards.</p>\n<p>Arguably the biggest issue facing importers today is the lack of visibility and transparency in their supply-side networks. You don’t have to dig very deep to find countless examples of brands being exposed by convoluted, multi-tier supplier structures, all of which contribute to the fragility we’ve seen in the global supply chain over the past couple of years. Mercado Plan is purposefully designed to bring greater visibility, transparency, and (crucially) trust to the ways in which businesses work and engage with their third-party partners.</p>\n<p>The new application will sit alongside Mercado’s existing first-mile product suite that includes <a href=\"https://mercadolabs.com/buy\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mercado Buy</a> for procurement teams, and <a href=\"https://mercadolabs.com/move\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mercado Move</a> aimed at logistics functions. Mercado Plan adds a supplier focus to the product suite and radically shifts the way importing brands build relationships around external partners who are involved in the planning, buying, and moving of their products.</p>\n<p>Find out more information over at <a href=\"http://mercadolabs.com/plan\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">mercadolabs.com/plan</a>.</p>\n<h1>About The Author</h1>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-13777 size-medium alignleft\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Mercado-Rob-New-Headshot-01-Square-Jaz-Newberry-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Mercado-Rob-New-Headshot-01-Square-Jaz-Newberry-300x300.jpg 300w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Mercado-Rob-New-Headshot-01-Square-Jaz-Newberry-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Mercado-Rob-New-Headshot-01-Square-Jaz-Newberry-150x150.jpg 150w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Mercado-Rob-New-Headshot-01-Square-Jaz-Newberry-768x767.jpg 768w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Mercado-Rob-New-Headshot-01-Square-Jaz-Newberry-600x599.jpg 600w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Mercado-Rob-New-Headshot-01-Square-Jaz-Newberry-100x100.jpg 100w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Mercado-Rob-New-Headshot-01-Square-Jaz-Newberry.jpg 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></p>\n<div class=\"Qr7Oae\" role=\"listitem\">\n<div class=\"OxAavc NVbRL\" data-required=\"true\" data-item-id=\"254210850\">\n<div class=\"Ih4Dzb\">\n<div class=\"q4tvle JqSWld yqQS1\">A highly accomplished Global Supply Chain executive with 25 years of experience, Rob Garrison has provided strategic vision and leadership to Fortune 500 companies.

    "web_content": "<p>The need and opportunity for back-office automation are straightforward. A tight labor market means employees are both more expensive and harder to find &#8211; and talent more important to preserve. At the same time, dynamics and complexities created by supply chain disruptions, bottlenecks and capacity challenges require more attention by an already stretched staff.</p>\n<p>While technologies advance, implementing software to improve the productivity of the labor force isn’t easy. In addition to all the normal change management aspects typical of technology implementations (reading and communicating with the team, understanding current processes, and designing / putting in place the &#8216;to be&#8217;), robotics and automation carry additional aspects of identifying repetitive and definable processes the technology can viably operationally handle, and rebalancing the role of the associate.</p>\n<p><strong>These two additional aspects are critical.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>To be operationally viable and gain real adoption, successful production levels need to be closer to 98.5% &#8211; using a typical KPI service level on 3PLs as a base-line.</li>\n<li>Rebalancing the role of the associate involves both nuance and considerations involving staff. Introducing automation is not simply eliminating the task but, rather, shifting the role of the associate vs the technology &#8211; for example it’s no longer about the associate keying in the data on the commercial invoice but rather initiating the process and spot-checking results. Setting the process up in a way that’s consistent with the user’s experience may ease the transition.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Doing all of this against logistics operations&#8217; dynamic backdrop and typically tight financial margins is a tall ask. Shortcuts get taken and suboptimal outcomes can easily result.</p>\n<p>Finding a software partner with domain expertise who understands the realities of the technologies and has developed a solution with the needed accuracy is critical.</p>\n<p>At <a href=\"https://www.prompt.global/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Prompt</a>, we start with an experienced and operations-centered vantage point, and our software solutions and supporting services with this in mind.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://prompt.global/data-entry-automation/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Automate</a>, our data extraction and integration platform, has been designed to optimize the balance of user, templates, and machine learning to achieve a 98% plus hit rate (and sixteen different documents, 70 languages – including QR codes, and handling both type-written text and handwriting). The user identifies what’s on the document (using terms they are familiar with) and where, after processing, verifies and submits the output. We’ve already done the work to tie the user terms to the database’s requirements and the system does the work.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://prompt.global/case-studies/crowley-maritime-improving-employee-efficiency-in-entering-commercial-invoice-data/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">result</a> is straightforward – with productivity improvements ranging from 80% to 400%.</p>\n<p>More importantly, this frees up time and attention for your teams to apply to other areas. They don’t need to spend days entering a 100-plus page commercial invoice and, rather, get it done in 15 minutes and spend their invaluable attention on taking care of your customers.</p>\n<p>Plus, we provide a managed services desk if you would prefer to focus your team’s time and attention on other tasks or allow for a more extended ramp-up time. Things won’t simply be turnkey as ‘operations’ (and factoring into the hit rate) means we need to go through some detail to confirm the specifics of what goes where, but our objective is to make it as easy as we effectively and realistically can make it.</p>\n<p>This approach &#8211; designing data automation tools to cost effectively address data needs and do so in an operationally viable way to improve back-office efficiency &#8211; is <a href=\"https://prompt.global/discover-prompt/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">embedded</a> throughout the Prompt platform and how we’re proceeding.</p>\n<p>For example, our Connect platform, uses a similar mindset in data integrations &#8211; a standard semantic grammar to make sense of inbound data as it relates, for example, to shipment events or invoices and a consistent set of steps to process prior to outbound translation (validate, convert, supplement). We’re seeing the results with our objectives to bring the integration development times and expenses down by at least 50%.</p>\n<p>While the direct cost savings is important, Connect’s benefits to back-office automation is similar: allowing your team’s time and attention to focus on other, more valuable activities.</p>\n<p>Automating more of what’s going on in your back-office is critical and more likely to be successful with the right partner.</p>\n<p>Learn more about implementing <a href=\"https://www.prompt.global/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Prompt</a>’s platform and how we can help.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>About The Author</h1>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-13661 alignleft\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Kai-2-Charlie-Pesti-240x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"240\" height=\"300\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Kai-2-Charlie-Pesti-240x300.jpg 240w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Kai-2-Charlie-Pesti.jpg 512w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px\" />Kai Timmermann, Chief Operating Officer at Prompt, is a thirty-year veteran in supply chain with a successful track record of creating high-performance organizations.

She is a certified speaker and trainer and actively volunteers as the Chairperson of WiLAT Cote D’Ivoire, helping women in more than 30 countries make big moves in Logistics and Transport.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>1. How did your supply chain journey start?</strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have held leadership positions in various private and public companies for more than 20 years, including: Distribution, ICT, Automotive, Agricultural and international public fields. These opportunities have helped me improve my managerial capabilities, grow as a leader, and develop and streamline strategies and policies in an international environment. I graduated from the <a href=\"https://www.inphb.ci/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Felix Houphouet Boigny &#8211; National Polytechnic Institute of Ivory Coast</a> in 2002 with an engineering degree in Logistics and Transport. I had already started working at SAPH (Société Africaine de Plantations d’Hévéas) as a Sales administration manager.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To increase my knowledge in Management and perform my technical capacities in Supply Chain Management within an international environment, I decided to apply for an MBA (specialized Supply Chain Management) at the <a href=\"https://student.kedge.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kedge Business School in France</a>. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since graduating from Kedge, I’ve worked in a variety of roles, including logistics manager, operations and quality manager, project logistics manager, and purchasing and logistics director—quickly growing my seniority and experience through a commitment to my work and values to help others succeed and move ahead. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I worked at international organizations and built my global professional network before moving on to work as Head of Procurement for an African organization in the Travel and Stores Division where I led a team of more than thirty members strong at the African Union in Addis Ababa. I pioneered strategic projects and decisions involving the whole organization represented across four continents. I also represented the African Union to enhance the organization’s reputation and visibility. Today, I am the Regional Senior Procurement Officer of the UN agency, IFAD – International Fund for Agricultural Development in charge of 24 countries in West and Central Africa.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>2. How have mentors supported your career growth in the supply chain?</strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I met my supply chain mentor while working as a Logistics and Procurement Director where he was the Chief Executive Officer. To this day, he continues to mentor me by extending advice, challenging me to set my goals higher, and sharing knowledge and experience from his own career journey. He helps me learn to anticipate and avoid problems to save time, money, and other resources. </span></p>\r\n<p><strong>3. Tell us about what it&#8217;s like to be a woman in a male-dominated industry:</strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At twenty-eight years old,  I was hired as the Purchasing and Logistics Director in a factory. It is quite challenging for a young manager to lead in logistics especially considering the African context when it comes to cultural cues and norms. On top of that, being a woman doesn’t make managing any simpler. In the African culture, power and authority are represented by a portion of elderly men. Having workers report to a woman manager is not a cultural or societal norm, and it’s still viewed by many as inappropriate.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Women in a typical African society are expected to be well-behaved, make good wives, and not speak when their elders are talking. Their male counterparts, however, have an enormous amount of autonomy.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The male-dominated logistics industry was also a barrier making things worse. Women in these types of environments face a variety of challenges, including damaging societal expectations and beliefs about womens’ limitations and leadership abilities; pervasive, outdated stereotypes of the “caring mother” or “office housekeeper,” and a lack of mentoring and career development opportunities.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In spite of all these barriers, I work to find ways to gain recognition and acceptance as a leader. I have learned and practiced the principles of a strong mindset, growing people, and connecting with them—acting as a servant leader. I serve the people around me, first. </span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I gain more professional momentum when I help others become leaders too. And like Tom Peters famously says: “Leaders don’t create followers, they create more leaders.” That resonates with my approach and management style.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">4. How did your passion for logistics start?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 1998 when I was in my second year, I had to take the entrance exam for the engineering portion at my business school. There were four options, marketing was my first choice and logistics was my third. It was incredibly competitive with a limited number of admission placements. I kept hearing that the most important thing is to be admitted regardless of your preferred choice. I didn’t agree though, I wanted to enter my number one choice: Marketing.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the results came in my father brought them on his way back to the garage with his car and he banged on the entrance gate. I was instantly alarmed, thinking this can’t be a good sign. Instead, he told me that I had been admitted to the engineering course but in the logistics area—my third choice. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was happy to know that I wouldn’t be retaking my prior year, but devastated not to specialize in my first choice, marketing. I had imagined myself in marketing for so long that it felt impossible to see myself doing anything else. But, I couldn’t change the results, so I started researching the logistics field which I knew nothing about—literally nothing, I had zero information. So, I made an appointment with the president of the student engineers in logistics to learn more and he reassured me by providing more details, presenting me with opportunities, and showing me a future in supply chain, ripe with potential and possibilities.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I took the plunge and went for it. I studied and worked hard to excel. I constantly researched logstics to learn more. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Peter Drucker says, “the best way to predict the future is to create it.” So, I did.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I studied and worked hard to excel. I do a lot of research to learn. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After my program for logistics engineer, I started my career as a logistics assistant, then I quickly climbed the ladder in several private companies before becoming a logistics manager before I turned thirty. For more than 5 years, I have held a prestigious position in Supply Chain/Logistics on a continental scale. I share my experience with other young people to encourage them to enter the logistics industry. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, I am promoting all the opportunities in logistics, an area I wanted nothing to do with a little more than two decades ago. Even though it wasn’t part of “the plan,” pursuing logistics made me embrace working on myself and finding all the means to succeed, (usually in the form of technical training, managerial courses, apprenticeships, mentorships, etc.) </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve come such a long way. I was able to transform my “third choice” into a tremendous victory and an enduring and rewarding professional calling. My supply chain journey constantly reinforces the importance of adopting the right attitude to make the best of whatever situation we’re going through. We can’t change events, but we can decide how we are going to respond to them, it’s entirely up to us.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>5. Is there anyone you admire professionally who influenced your work?</strong> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I admire Madam Mariam DAO Gabala, an Ivorian woman born in 1960 with proven credentials for her leadership and work in Africa and beyond. She was the chairperson of the Ivorian Football Federation, a male-dominated organization. Madam Gabala is also acknowledged for her important role and contribution for sustainable development, youth entrepreneurship, and financial inclusion of those in the most need, specifically women. She is very active in promoting and developing female leadership at every level of the African society. Madam Gabala is the President of the Coalition of Female Leaders of Côte d’Ivoire. I look up to her because she lives and breathes the professional values that motivate me as she works to help other women reach higher.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>6. What does it mean to you to be featured in Women In Supply Chain™?</strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s Talk Supply Chain shares valuable content from global experts, and I am proud to be a part of that. This feature is an amazing opportunity to reach a broader audience of women in the industry as a resource they know and trust. I’m also proud to represent the Women In Supply Chain™ in Africa where logistics is not so well known, and we are doing our best to make a difference and change the game. </span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I also want to share about the international organization, WiLAT, Women in Logistics and Transport. It is the female branch of CILT, the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport, a century-old organization.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>7. What advice do you have for women looking to start in the supply chain industry?</strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You have to keep the focus on others and be people-oriented. Be ready to learn more about yourself and build your own strengths to gain momentum and efficiency in your work and home life. Focus on being results-oriented. Excellence is an enduring value. Even when you’re working to empower others, you’re still coaching and helping them to deliver their best. Try to find a balance—that is real life.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, never give up. You need to be resilient and ready to learn and listen to managers and mentors. Find someone who inspires you with shared values who you can learn from in your professional space.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>8. What&#8217;s next on your supply chain journey?</strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a servant leader, I want to continue influencing my community in a positive way through supply chain education and coaching in other areas including Personal Development, Leadership Skills, and other soft skills necessary to create a meaningful career. In 2019, a Gallup poll found that only 15% of the world’s one billion full-time workers are engaged at work. That means an astronomical 85% of professionals are unhappy in their jobs. </span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I want to help change that by playing an active role to help others find fulfillment at work to:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mentor future generations in leadership and supply chain from a young age to help them choose a vocation and not a profession.</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Help these up-and-comers develop a strong mix of soft skills to support their professional growth.</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Teach the importance of taking accountability to step up as a true leader.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have started taking these steps with <a href=\"https://www.wilat.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WiLAT</a> and <a href=\"https://ciltuk.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CILT</a> and look forward to making a greater impact in my local and global supply chain community.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m also dedicated to establishing CILT in Francophone, Africa soon—opening a representation in Cote D’Ivoire. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I want to give local Supply chain professionals the opportunity to keep learning through regular continuing education and webinars, build their networks outside of their native countries, and discover more business opportunities. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These grassroots goals and efforts to develop local supply chain communities are going to help amass a new generation of effective leaders with values and the ability to tackle the root causes of Africa’s underdevelopment firsthand. Under development in Africa is a result of many contributing factors, including a poverty mindset, illiteracy, very large, extended families, corruption, and a lack of accountability. The Covid-19 crisis has shown us how important resilience is, and how critical soft skills are to creating a people-first approach in our communities and at work.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I want to continue raising awareness among young people so they’ll enter supply chain as a profession by choice. By encouraging women to work in male-dominated industries, businesses can increase their performance and retention rates with a larger number of women in leadership positions—able to move the needle.</span></p>\r\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><em>This Women In Supply Chain™ feature was made possible by our sponsor, Emerge.

    "web_content": "<p>As a consequence of containerization, maritime transport became integrated with land transport, resulting in the provision of efficient intermodal transport. Intermodal transport that links factories and warehouses in many parts of the world in a door-to-door manner has become a crucial service for shippers. Shippers believe that concentrating business resources on their area of expertise is competitively advantageous, and logistics outsourcing has increased. Intermodal transport is the focal service in the wide range of logistics services including storage, inventory control and packaging, and has produced added value to maritime services, making it an important field in maritime research.</p>\n<p>Transport using several modes has been called variously and almost synonymously ‘intermodal transport’, ‘multimodal transport’ and ‘combined transport’. The responsibilities of the shipping companies in international maritime transport are regulated by the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act enacted in each country, which was based on the Hague Convention, the Hague-Visby Rules and the Hamburg Rules. As global intermodal transport developed, international agreements that include transport responsibilities during transit by land have likewise been expanded. The Convention on International Multimodal Transport of Goods (MT Convention) adopted in 1980 by the United Nations is one of these agreements.</p>\n<p>The MT Convention defines ‘multimodal transport’ as ‘the carriage of goods by at least two different modes of transport on the basis of a multimodal transport contract from a place in one country at which the goods are taken in charge by the multimodal transport operator to a place designated for delivery situated in a different country.’</p>\n<p>In Europe, the United Nations Economic and Social Council defines intermodal transport as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Multimodal transport: Carriage of goods by two or more modes of transport.</li>\n<li>Intermodal transport: The movement of goods in one and the same loading unit or road vehicle.</li>\n<li>Combined transport: Intermodal transport where the major part of the European journey is by rail, inland waterways or sea and any initial and/or final legs carried out by road.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The intermodal transport route might be significantly shorter than the maritime transport route depending on geographic condition. When compared to the Asia/East Coast sea route that navigates through the Panama Canal, the Asia/East Coast mini-landbridge route passing the West Coast using transcontinental trains can be shorter in terms of haul distance and transport time. Similarly, the haul distance of the Siberia Land Bridge using the Trans-Siberian Railway is shorter than the Asia/Europe sea route that navigates through the Suez Canal.</p>\n<p>For the shipper, the greatest advantage of intermodal transport is the possibility to easily employ seamless door-to-door transport. It is troublesome to arrange the use of separate transport modes, especially in foreign countries. For intermodal transport, even when an accident happens, the intermodal transport operator takes the responsibility regardless of the transport segment. For non-intermodal transport, it is necessary to claim compensation from the transport company dealing with each segment.</p>\n<p>One of the advantages of using intermodal transport is consolidation. Consolidation leads to economies of scale and the possibility to transport goods more economically. The relationship of such traditional vessels to container vessels is very similar to the relationship between small and large container vessels in terms of transport costs, and between small- and large-scale terminals in terms of transshipment costs.</p>\n<p>For longer inland transport distances, the use of rail and inland water transport becomes advantageous as both have lower transport costs. This shift has also been proven to effectively reduce CO2 emissions, which has become an important policy issue.</p>\n<p>This extract from <a href=\"https://www.koganpage.com/product/maritime-logistics-9781789661699\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Maritime Logistics</em></a> by Dong-Wook Song and Photis Panayides is ©2021 and reproduced with permission from Kogan Page Ltd.

    "web_content": "<p>We are now at a stage where the challenges within the supply chain are necessitating a change of mindset amongst warehouse operators, with automation and robotics being considered a viable, and at times necessary, alternative to large amounts of labor.</p>\n<p>We are also seeing companies introducing robotics on a large scale. Amazon recently received a patent for its idea of a warehouse in the sky with orders being fulfilled in an airship and the items being delivered by drones. They’ve also filed a patent for underwater warehouses utilizing acoustic vibrations to make packages rise to the surface. Farfetched it may seem, but these companies are pushing the envelope to meet ever-increasing and complicated challenges. The development of AI and VR will also have a significant effect on warehousing in the future.</p>\n<p>Let’s create a context and examine the factors that will affect warehousing in the future:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Globally, we have a growing but aging population. Land will then be at a premium, with some research suggesting that 70% of the world’s population will be living in cities by 2030. There are likely to be labor shortages in key areas, which suggests a significant growth in automation, but in those areas where automation is not an option there will be a need for elder-friendly workplaces, and in some countries people will be required to prolong their working lives.</li>\n<li>The growing economies of BRICS countries and those of the developing world, especially in Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam where consumerism and the growth of the internet will put even greater pressure on consumer product manufacturers and their warehouses.</li>\n<li>As economies grow and the population gets older, there will be greater competition for staff. Warehousing has not been a career of choice for many because of its image, and companies are going to have to market themselves better to become more attractive. The introduction of more technology into these warehouses will be significant. Conversely, the introduction of greater automation could see a reduction in the requirement for staff at an operational level but an increase in more technologically astute staff. The closure of many high street retailers because of the move away from purchases from bricks-and-mortar stores to online will see the possibility of staff re-deployment into the retail fulfilment centers.</li>\n<li>Sustainability will play a significant role in supply chain operations. The green lobby will look to the supply chain for initiatives in terms of alternative energy use, reduction in CO2 emissions, reduction in waste and water usage, and the use of alternative forms of transport. This will include intermodal transport initiatives as well as fuel-efficient MHE. Consumers and retailers will also be encouraged to source locally, leading to an increase in demand for neighborhood warehouses.</li>\n<li>As fossil fuels decline, there will be a move towards more sustainable energy. Companies will look to warehouse automation and the use of greener vehicles, whilst developers and warehouse operators will be encouraged to consider solar panels, wind turbines and the use of waste product for energy production. New and existing warehouses will be equipped with electric charging points for delivery vehicles and hydrogen filling stations.</li>\n<li>An increasing pressure on companies to collaborate and share resources. Many warehouses and transport modes are under-utilized, so pressure from the green lobby and continued pressure to further reduce costs will encourage more companies to collaborate.</li>\n<li>The shortage of and subsequent increasing cost of land will see the development of more underground warehouses.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This extract from <em><a href=\"https://www.koganpage.com/product/warehouse-management-9781789668407\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Warehouse Management</a> </em>by Gwynne Richards is ©2021 and reproduced and with permission from Kogan Page Ltd.

Truck drivers, warehouse workers and more are quitting due to a lack of opportunity for promotion, skill advancement or career progression.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other top reasons include incorrect job expectations and poor onboarding. Why are big brands only focusing on pay? Seeing as replacing a supply chain employee is costing businesses anywhere from $5,000 to $45,000, this error is hurting the bottom line.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hourly workers don’t have a “clock-in, clock-out, cash the paycheck” mentality. They want a meaningful and rewarding career. But management teams aren’t regularly checking in, collecting feedback and developing career paths with their reports. The vicious cycle continues.</span></p>\n<h5><b>The Key to Stopping the Revolving Turnover Door.</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The only way to prevent turnover is to continuously gather real-time feedback from your frontline and to use this critical insight as a backdrop for driving positive change and outcomes for all. It may seem impossible to engage with each employee one-on-one monthly, biweekly or more – but technology is available to help.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WorkStep</span><a href=\"https://go.workstep.com/retain/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RETAIN</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> provides a platform that automatically delivers check-ins during key milestones across an employee’s employment journey allowing frontline workers to provide critical feedback to their employer, and allowing the employer to take action on this insight and drive positive outcomes &#8211; all in one central repository. As organizational improvements are made, you can also track the impact this has on turnover. RETAIN is proven to resolve up to 36% of turnover issues.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Giving your frontline workers the opportunity to feel heard empowers them. All of a sudden, their voice matters – and they hold the power to share their experience and drive real change. But most importantly, regularly collecting and listening to employee feedback has the potential to transform your business, build a culture to be proud of, reduce turnover and ultimately protect the bottom line. </span></p>\n<h5><b>Start RETAINING Your Employees Today.</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The supply chain workforce is changing – and your workplace should, too.

    "web_content": "<p>One of the things people are starting to realize is that relationships and collaboration matters. Many shippers have forever viewed their relationships with their transportation providers as tactical rather than strategic, and they’re the ones suffering the most with today’s supply chain challenges. Simply taking the time to develop meaningful and long-term relationships can eliminate so many headaches down the road.</p>\n<h5>Q: How can collaboration be used to build relationships?</h5>\n<p>A: Education plays an important role. For instance, a typical LTL carrier has an economic disincentive to educate their customers. If you have the wrong NMFC number for the items you’re shipping, your costs can increase dramatically. Unfortunately, a carrier will almost never tell you about a misclassification when you should be getting charged less. However, as a 3PL, we have an economic incentive to educate our customers because we can only grow if we are able to show our customers a savings and a higher level of service. So, one of the services we provide with the onboarding of any customer is looking at every item they are shipping, matching NMFC numbers for that item, the correct freight class, and tariff they should be using. In turn, allowing them to gain the best value for their freight spend.</p>\n<h5>Q: What technology solutions can be utilized to create efficiency for SMB’s?</h5>\n<p>A: We found in our research that about 90% of companies with less than $250 million in revenue don’t have a Transportation Management System to help them professionally manage their freight. We built our <a href=\"https://www.r2logistics.com/tms/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">TMS</a> from the shipper’s perspective, and it encompasses everything that a Transportation Manager would need to manage their organization’s freight spend. Whether that be reporting or on-demand track and trace tools. The R2 TMS is specifically designed for those SMB’s that don’t have the budget to justify an enterprise solution.</p>\n<h5>Q: How long does it take to implement the R2 TMS?</h5>\n<p>A: We like to measure implementation in days not months, but the process can go as fast as the customer is willing. Where our TMS really shines is in the data aggregation phase. We request three to six months of customer data so we can preload it into the system. This includes everything from their products, freight classes, origins and destinations. We also do an NMFC audit on all their freight to make sure they’re not being overcharged. Taking all this data and translating it into meaningful reports allows our customers to make good decisions quicker and gives them a competitive advantage against larger corporations. Typical implementation time is two to three weeks before the customer is up and running.</p>\n<h3>About the Author</h3>\n<p><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-12551 alignleft\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/transportation-solutions-300x201.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"201\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/transportation-solutions-300x201.png 300w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/transportation-solutions.png 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/episode251/\">Frank Dreischarf</a> is a graduate of The Ohio State University where he dual majored in Operations Management as well as Transportation and Logistics.

    "web_content": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last few years haven’t been without their challenges. Supply chain disruptions catapulted our industry to the tip of the public’s tongue. And the ride isn’t quite over yet. As we’re rearing our heads above water, 2022 presents a whole new set of challenges for 3PLs and LSPs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But luckily, Fourkites’ already started to find solutions to these predicted struggles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today we’re bringing you an exclusive perspective from Raj Patel, VP of Industry Strategy, 3PLs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the end of this, you’ll understand the three pressing challenges for third-party logistic providers (3PLs) or logistic service providers (LSPs) and Raj’s key insights on how to overcome them.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Current Supply Chain Trends for 3PLs and LSPs Are Creating New Challenges</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s hard to nail down all of the obstacles facing the industry. But Patel offers 3PLs and LSPs three key areas to pay attention to.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Labor. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Supply chainers will be the first to tell you that labor’s been an issue. So, it’s important to pay attention to how you’re using your current labor, how you recruit, and how you retain. It’s about balancing your labor compared to robotics and having visibility to where your labor is.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Cost. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’ve heard about inflation &#8211; but who actually pays for the rising costs? Have a plan in place to understand where this increase flows.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Innovation. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The future is here and it’s about time to think about how robotics (autonomous vehicles, picking, etc.) fits into your business, how your supply chain affects environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals, distribution center locations and implementable technology.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blowing in with the trends listed above are the new services having to be offered by 3PLs and LSPs. They’re stepping out of their comfort zones, and we’re here for it. </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Value-Added Services are the New Black</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Industry changes mean a new dynamic of operations. In order to keep up with the waves of change, logistic providers are having to roll up their sleeves and offer new services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being innovative with what you provide to clients is going to add a significant amount of value to your business and customers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Historically done in field-stocking locations, logistic providers can determine where warehouses are needed to reach 90% of the U.S. population. . 3PLs are making more logical, logistical choices. But they still need more, smaller microfufillmment centers in order to reach 90% within the one-day delivery consumers expect. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So how can they get there? With the help of artificial intelligence/machine learning. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And while LSPs have usually stayed in their own lane with basic monthly forecasts, Patel tells us they’re now pulling up a seat to the table with their client’s marketing, sales, and operations teams. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For visibility in planning in order to identify which products are super important. Are there campaigns that will affect planning? 3PLs are starting to get their hands dirty in this essential execution process. The result is a smoother start-to-finish, higher sales, and increased customer satisfaction. </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitigating Risk in a New, Risky World</span></h3>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The new normal.” “Unprecedented times.”</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Just a few of the buzzwords our team at Let&#8217;s Talk Supply Chain™ hears all the time. Along with </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“agility”</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“resilience”</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Patel stresses to us that this agility and resilience always comes with a price. For example, in order to be agile and resilient, you might have to be tripled-sourced which will come at a cost to your overall supply chain.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That safety-stock and extra inventory that was once frowned upon is now expected. A question probed by Patel, “What if the war in Europe doesn’t end? What if the Suez Canal happens again?” It’s these sort of world events that we’re not used to that we now, well, have to get used to.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to mitigate risk, Patel also encourages you to know your suppliers and vendors—and who they’re getting their materials from. In essence, don’t put all of your eggs into one basket.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Micro-fulfillment centers (MFCs) and other strategies can deliver you to agility and resilience, but beware of that fine balance between cost and risk. </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Visibility is Good, But Actionable Visibility is Better</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gaining visibility to your supply chain is one thing. And while the ability to see where your container is at sea or on the road is possible, Patel argues that having actionable visibility is a whole other storm. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because really, what is it exactly that we might do with that visibility once we get it? </span><a href=\"https://www.fourkites.com/platform/real-time-visibility/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fourkites’ visibility platform</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> allows companies to identify implementable strategies and make confident, prosperous decisions through tons of predictive analytics and machine learning. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s something I can get behind—no more guessing, no more surprises. We’ll always find ways to pivot, supply chainers! So let’s go to visibility and beyond!</span></p>\n",

    "web_content": "<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented interruptions and challenges in almost every sector of business, including logistics and the supply chain. In 2020 when Covid first emerged as a global crisis and businesses began to temporarily shut down or reduce their operations, the global economy was temporarily turned off. As more information became available and as some mitigation strategies were put in place, the economy quickly rebounded, creating an environment where shipping demand outpaced market capacity. With many consumers spending more time at home and having access to more disposable income than in recent history, demand for goods raised retail volumes, specifically with-in the e-commerce space that are now years ahead of schedule with a supply chain that has struggled to keep up. From back-logs at ports, to driver shortages, to reduced equipment availability and an overall lack of predictability and precision, logistics companies along with shippers had to respond quickly in order to best meet their business needs in this new environment.</p>\n<p><strong>Here are some Do’s and Don’ts that can help guide businesses through any crisis:</strong></p>\n<h4>Do’s</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>If you have not done so already &#8211; establish clear business needs and goals. This may seem obvious but to navigate any type of crisis, one should truly understand what the needs and goals of the business are and where the business is headed. Every major business decision should be aligned with achieving those goals. If you already have a plan but have had to “look under the hood”, it would be a good time to do an overall review of the business and reassess the goals of your organization.</li>\n<li>Be ready and willing to pivot when a scenario is not going as expected. Use existing resources in new ways to adapt to quickly changing situations. “This is how we always do things” and like language needs to be eliminated from your vocabulary. Do take the situation that your business is facing as an opportunity to be your own consultant with-in your business and to be a stronger leader and company as a result of it.</li>\n<li>Engage your partnerships and work together. Have open and candid conversations with vendors, clients, customers and staff about the challenges that have come up. With clear communication, these relationships can be strengthened and keep everyone working with synergy towards a common goal. The strongest partnerships are ones where expectations from all parties are understood and in alignment with the business goals.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Don’ts</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Don’t overreact and throw away what is working. Trust what your company has done to become successful and continue to invest in the people and processes that support this success. “Stay calm and trust the process.”</li>\n<li>Although you should not overreact, don’t expect to see different results if nothing changes. In times of adversity and uncertainty, doing nothing and “hoping” things will get better is not always the best strategy.</li>\n<li>Don’t be the victim. It can be too easy to want to blame external factors that you may have limited to zero control over, such as the economy and the overall environment that may be impacting your business in a negative way. Focus on what you can control and do not make excuses.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Adapting to adversity in uncertain times requires a deft willingness to meet the moment. With agility, clear communication and the willingness to think and act differently, companies can position themselves to not Only survive a crisis, but to be better because of it.</p>\n<h2>About the Author</h2>\n<p><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-12729 size-medium alignleft\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/083-Ashley-Caloia-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/083-Ashley-Caloia-300x200.jpg 300w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/083-Ashley-Caloia-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/083-Ashley-Caloia-768x512.jpg 768w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/083-Ashley-Caloia-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/083-Ashley-Caloia-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/083-Ashley-Caloia-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></p>\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewNumberedItemContainer\" role=\"listitem\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsItemItem freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextTextItem\" data-required=\"true\" data-item-id=\"254210850\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextTextItemContainer\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextLongText freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextDisabledText freebirdThemedInput\">Kristy Knichel, a lifelong Pittsburgh native, is a second-generation logistics executive.

    "web_content": "<p>The proverb that the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step might seem like an amusing paradox for supply chain professionals. On the one hand, the road to digital maturity is daunting, and many companies are only just setting out on the path to end-to-end visibility and intelligent risk management. Yet on the other hand, the journey itself might not be well-defined, let alone the destination.</p>\n<p>Overhaul sponsored the recent <a href=\"https://gdssummits.com/event/supply-chain-insight-summit-na-feb-22/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GDS North America Supply Chain Digital Summit</a>, helping to light a path through the big questions supply chain leaders – who represent some of the world’s largest technology, pharmaceutical, retail and manufacturing companies – continue to confront along their journeys. Read on to learn the three key themes that emerged and insights for each from <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/frankiemossman/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Frankie Mossman</a>, Overhaul’s Chief Customer Officer.</p>\n<p><strong>Smart data make smart supply chains</strong></p>\n<p>Supply chain leaders recognize that now is the time to make big investments and bold decisions. <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/2021-02-10-gartner-survey-finds-87-of-supply-chain-professionals-plan-to-invest-in-resilience-within-the-next-2-years\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">A 2021 Gartner survey</a> found that nearly 90 percent planned to invest in supply chain resilience, and 80 percent said that new technology would be needed over the next three years. But technology is only one component of smart supply chains.</p>\n<p>“Data is everywhere, and it can be overwhelming,” says Frankie. “But we need to make it manageable and actionable so that we can make better decisions and orchestrate across the entire supply-chain ecosystem.” Smart supply chains are defined by the problems they solve, not the technology or software they use. “A smart supply chain needs to know what’s happening,” Frankie explains, but it’s ultimately only as smart as the data we prioritize.</p>\n<p><strong>Agility versus resiliency</strong></p>\n<p>‘Agility’ and ‘resiliency’ are two words often used interchangeably with respect to supply chain, notes Frankie, especially in recent news stories about disruptions and shortages. But they have a clear distinction. “Resiliency is making sure that you’re ready for the worst-case scenario, which means you do have to have more reserve stock and redundancies. Agility is taking advantage of an opportunity.”</p>\n<p>Over the past two years, virtually every industry has had to be more agile, especially in decision-making. “The pandemic forced us to make decisions much faster and get out of our comfort zones around how we use data and share information,” says Frankie. “But it also revealed where we weren’t resilient and didn’t have redundant sources of supply and inventory.”</p>\n<p>Similarly, companies shouldn’t interchange how they execute. “You need to have a strategy as to whether you want to be an agile or a resilient supply chain,” emphasizes Frankie. “Supply chains can be both, depending on the business models they support,” but this hybrid requires clear definition. Although it may seem counterintuitive, simultaneously pursuing agility and resilience could undermine how well a supply chain is equipped for the next seismic shift.</p>\n<p><strong>Transition versus transformation</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/five-fifty-the-quickening\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">According to McKinsey</a>, e-commerce in the US grew at a 10-year pace within the first quarter of 2020 and the onset of the pandemic. As consumers quickly transitioned to find alternatives to brick-and-mortar stores, they ignited a long-term transformation of how we source, manufacture and distribute goods across a full spectrum of industries.</p>\n<p>The tension between transition and transformation also fine-tunes supply chains. As Frankie puts it, “Transition is continuous improvement, where we take the building blocks that we have today and make them slightly better. Transformation is thinking completely differently.”</p>\n<p>She points to the 2021 blockage of the Suez Canal as another transformational flashpoint. Its aftermath spurred shippers to take short-term action like evaluating alternate routes, and underscored complex, long-term questions. Poor infrastructure, climate change and changing consumer behaviors all were contributing forces, and they will likely play significant roles in the event of a future similar incident. “We’re never going to have perfect data. But we can intelligently know the direction we need to go and how to take that next step.”</p>\n<p>A transformational mindset ultimately is what sets leading companies apart. “When you go on a transformational journey, you’re not going from zero to sixty,” says Frankie. “You don’t become a visible, smart supply chain tomorrow just because you plug in great software. It’s a journey that has iterations.”</p>\n<h5>About the Author</h5>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-12710 size-medium alignnone\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/OverhaulLogo_Original-2-Stephanie-Varty-300x49.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"49\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/OverhaulLogo_Original-2-Stephanie-Varty-300x49.png 300w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/OverhaulLogo_Original-2-Stephanie-Varty-1024x167.png 1024w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/OverhaulLogo_Original-2-Stephanie-Varty-768x125.png 768w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/OverhaulLogo_Original-2-Stephanie-Varty-1536x250.png 1536w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/OverhaulLogo_Original-2-Stephanie-Varty-2048x333.png 2048w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/OverhaulLogo_Original-2-Stephanie-Varty-600x98.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" />Founded in 2016 and headquartered in Austin, Texas, Overhaul is the industry’s first and only holistic, end-to-end solution that optimizes supply-chain visibility, integrity, and security for global enterprises.

    "web_content": "<p>Two years ago, when many of us first experienced the supply chain impacts of the pandemic, some situations were unprecedented – like empty store shelves, lack of availability of common household goods and only one means of shopping – e-commerce. Consumers adapted and anticipated a return to more typical conditions for purchasing CPG items. However, as new strains of the pandemic continue to emerge, along with inflation, those unprecedented events are becoming almost daily occurrences, along with rising prices for basic necessities.</p>\n<p>Clearly, the CPG sector faces many supply chain management challenges &#8211; everything from increasing costs for contract lanes due to a driver shortage, to containers sitting at ports for extended amounts of time. A solution &#8211; like shifting to air freight will solve the access to products, but significantly increase operating costs. Many CPG companies are increasing the price of goods to offset the cost of supply chain challenges. This begs the question – do CPGs face the risk of passing along such severe price hikes that consumers may not return once economic conditions stabilize?</p>\n<h4><strong>Diversification of suppliers and sourcing locations are no small tasks</strong></h4>\n<p>Some CPG companies have changed their supplier strategy from one with a few select suppliers to an increased number of vendors. Managing more vendors inherently requires more work on the part of the shipper. Other CPGs are looking at even more drastic changes, such as having products arrive at East Coast ports, even though the ultimate destination is a retail store in California. That real scenario is the fastest way for at least one company to maintain inventory to serve their customers</p>\n<p>While these strategies will help keep products on store shelves, they are not easy changes to implement and often have a negative impact on the shipper’s operational efficiency, at least in the early stages of adoption.</p>\n<h4><strong>Lifestyles have changed and consumer expectations are increasing</strong></h4>\n<p>While CPGs wrestle with these challenges, many consumers have changed their lifestyle and shopping habits. They count on e-commerce to have what they need and deliver it to their homes. This level of service may leave some consumers impatient with stock-outs or empty store shelves, especially combined with higher prices. And in reality, they do have other options – many items can be ordered online and in their hands within 24-48 hours.</p>\n<h4><strong>New challenges require new thinking and solutions</strong></h4>\n<p>To adapt to this new dynamic, CPGs must be able to quickly assess options and analyze potential gains versus risks. Having access to technology and market intelligence are basic building blocks. However, companies do not have the luxury of time to do exhaustive searches or requests for proposals.</p>\n<p>It is time to say goodbye to spreadsheets, manual bids done on an annual basis and make the most of the exciting new technologies that are reinventing many aspects of freight management, beginning with procurement.</p>\n<p>Is one bid a year agile enough to respond to a rapidly changing market? Do shippers or carriers have time to devote to many requests for proposals, which in the past have been very time-consuming? And can spread sheets and historical thinking “we’ve always done it this way” &#8211; offer the level of business intelligence needed for today’s supply chains?</p>\n<p>If even one of these answers is no, it may be time to <a href=\"https://emergemarket.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reinvent the freight proposal process with Emerge</a>, a leading freight procurement platform that uses a combination of leading-edge technology, market intelligence and expertise in the freight industry to help companies reinvent the freight proposal process while revolutionizing many aspects of how freight is sourced and shipped.

How can you incorporate sustainability into first, mid and last-mile delivery?</p>\n<h4><strong>The Ripple Effects of COP26 in Supply Chain Delivery </strong></h4>\n<p>As consumers increase their online purchases, the decarbonization of delivery transport has become a new challenge. Brands are beginning to reinvent their business models to handle products while being sensitive to sustainability goals. Transport decarbonization impacts last-mile delivery in logistics and the first and mid-mile of supply chain operations.</p>\n<p>The majority of consumer goods move by road transport. Sectors that focus on consumers, like retail, e-commerce, big &amp; bulky, courier express, and parcel will face the most significant impact of new decarbonization goals. How will brands and enterprises create and measure sustainable goals to reduce their carbon footprints across all delivery phases?</p>\n<h4><strong>FarEye’s Intelligent Supply Chain Platform Helps Brands Achieve Sustainability Goals</strong></h4>\n<p>While some 3PL carriers associated with top-tier brands and in-house logistics teams of global brands have access to tools to measure CO2 emissions accurately, most enterprises lack systems to capture the carbon emission readings of their fleets. Each business has unique supply chain delivery operations and the associated carbon emission struggles.</p>\n<p>FarEye’s Intelligent Supply Chain Platform helps enterprises fast-track their <a href=\"https://www.getfareye.com/sustainability/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sustainability</a> goals using a science-based CO2 reduction approach.

    "web_content": "<p>The workforce is only expected to grow 4% in the next decade. Compare that with the 1970s at 30% or the 2000s at 9%, and it&#8217;s easy to see why we&#8217;re seeing more alarmist headlines about The Great Resignation. For the first time in well, modern history, there are one and a half jobs open for hire for every unemployed American. At virtually any other point, all employers had to do was post a job online or help wanted sign and wait for the applicants. Now, everything is changing.</p>\n<p>In response to a pandemic, professionals across generational gaps are reevaluating the why and how behind their work. An unprecedented talent shortage is clashing abruptly with a wave of Baby Boomer retirements. There&#8217;s a powerful seachange coming to corporate culture and work-life ethos, driven by a millennial-dominated workforce that&#8217;s been working through a global pandemic for two years.</p>\n<p>They don&#8217;t want to hear about hustle culture anymore. In fact, <a href=\"https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/toxic-culture-is-driving-the-great-resignation/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">according to a recent study</a>, burning out and overwhelming employees and creating a toxic working culture are a couple of the most common reasons employees are leaving their jobs in droves.</p>\n<p>The changing talent landscape is reframing how we traditionally think about outsourcing.</p>\n<h2>Empower your teams with outside expertise.</h2>\n<p>Employers are experiencing what Forbes labeled a &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2021/10/01/baby-boomers-are-leaving-the-workforce-to-live-their-best-lives-in-a-silver-tsunami-great-retirement-trend/?sh=35ba2c65260b\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Silver Tsunami</a>.&#8221; Almost 30 million Baby Boomers left the workplace in the third quarter of 2020 amidst the pandemic&#8217;s darkest days. The COVID-19 pandemic has been a driving force for the mass exodus of Boomers born between 1946 and 1964 to call it quits and put their health and wellbeing first. Many organizations are having trouble filling some of their most senior positions or eliminating them with so many leaving.</p>\n<p>That leaves serious knowledge gaps in different areas, including supply chain, operations, IT, sales, and marketing. Bringing outside experts in these areas can help your organization achieve a competitive edge while keeping your full-time team members inundated and educated on the latest best practices and approaches.</p>\n<h2>Put out the burnout.</h2>\n<p>As hiring becomes more challenging, running leaner businesses might sound attractive to employers looking to maximize profit margins. However,  attrition is expensive. Organizations must avoid burning out employees who can easily find another job with a better work-life balance—because they will. Identifying areas where your workforce can use support can help you support growing pains while empowering your talent to focus on what they know best—your customers.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also essential to focus on building an engaged, connected workforce backed by a vibrant, positive company culture. When you&#8217;re navigating supply chain shortages, an agile, competitive, digital market, and running all the basic business operations through an ongoing talent gap, that&#8217;s hard to do.</p>\n<p>Partnering with the right outsourcing organization can help you and your company leaders focus on keeping your existing workforce engaged and involved in your day-to-day work and company culture.</p>\n<h2>Take some pressure off of your middle management team.</h2>\n<p>Without a steady flow of new talent ready if and when an employee resigns, there&#8217;s a growing amount of anxiety among hiring managers juggling daily people operations, keeping teams across organizations in sync and aligned, and trying to retain talent. You might have a hard time filling new or existing positions quickly, and that&#8217;s where the right outsourcing partner can help you support your existing team members while you grow.</p>\n<p>Identifying areas where your management team can use support can help optimize business processes and let them focus more on people management and retention. Implementing the right outsourcing strategy can enable you to scale your workforce on a realistic timeline—no matter the job market conditions.</p>\n<h2><strong>The talent shortage has only started. How will you do more with less?</strong></h2>\n<p>Experts predict a <a href=\"https://www.economicmodeling.com/video/sansdemic-too-much-work-too-little-people/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sansdemic</a> for decades to come—literally translated as a shortage of people. It&#8217;s time to find strategic approaches to supporting your existing workforce to keep them and your business thriving. Turnover can be costly and devastating for small-to-medium-sized enterprises. Being able to flex and scale outside support across your business and supply chain operations can keep your organization moving through disruption and into the future—fast and strategically.</p>\n<h2><em>Ready to rethink your outsourcing strategy?</em></h2>\n<p>Unlike most offshoring partners, at Zenov, we offer a variety of services backed by a North-American-based executive office and staff.

    "web_content": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Snow in Texas. Wildfires, tsunamis and heatwaves— all of this plus shipping containers, air freight and exports being sent and seen around the world.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That makes anyone wonder exactly how much carbon dioxide is emitted into our air per gallon of diesel burned? Well, the U.S. EPA says 22.461 pounds. As it stands, climate change is an inevitable challenge the supply chain faces.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though dealing with climate change is unavoidable, supply chain companies and industry professionals have an undeniable chance to combat its effects. But tree-planting events, recycling programs and sustainable packing strategies are just a mere starting point. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reducing your emissions is key. End-to-end visibility is key. Not only for eco-friendly practices but for your bottom line. But you can’t, no matter how hard you try, reduce emissions unless you measure it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can monitor the pulse of your supply chain emissions using tools like the FourKites sustainability dashboard. Putting a plan in place to reduce emissions should be a central part of any green strategy.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going Green, But on a Global Level</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our planet is getting smaller. Not physically, but we’re able to communicate differently, easier.  Which should make it easy for countries to come together and make an impact. In fact, European companies were surveyed by </span><a href=\"https://www.fourkites.com/resources/state-of-the-european-supply-chain-logistics-sustainability-and-visibility-report-2022/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fourkites</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a leader in supply chain visibility. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The data found that business leaders there are already getting a head start on their sustainability plans. </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over 80% indicated they were increasing or maintaining their sustainability commitments.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">About 50% of respondents cited real-time supply chain visibility data as an essential part of identifying and hitting sustainability objectives.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">41% of respondents have trouble measuring their impact on sustainability.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some say,</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “green business is good business”</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It couldn’t be more true. We’re predicting that those who take sustainability seriously now, will still be in operation and making revenue in 2042. Those who chose to ignore the issue will soon find themselves lost in a figurative congested port.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Supply Chain Collaboration for Sustainability</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was an underlying theme at the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference. The message? Sustainability isn’t only assigned to political leaders. Companies need to step up and take charge. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a response to this and climate change, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has ordered that all vessels reduce emissions by half, and by the year 2050. Several fuel-efficient programs would need to be implemented over the next decade to meet these goals, because ships have a 20- to 25-year lifetime. It&#8217;s possible, but the required technologies would need to be honed in faster, at a higher scale, and at a lower cost.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With various kinds of micro-mobility and zero-emission (ZE) cars, buses, and light commercial vehicles, the decarbonization of transportation has come a long way in many countries. Despite this, medium- and heavy-duty trucks (MDTs and HDTs) have been lagging behind. Currently, road freight accounts for 53 percent of global trade-related emissions, and if current trends continue, that&#8217;s going to rise to 56 percent by 2050—right when IMO plans to half their emission outputs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite recent technological advancements that have put a low-carbon truck future within reach, increasing collaboration across the value chain will be necessary to succeed. A new initiative by the World Economic Forum (WEF) called Road Freight Zero (RFZ) aims to help companies join forces and develop solutions. Participants include manufacturers of consumer goods, logistics companies, fleet operators, energy, technology, and infrastructure firms, innovators, finance companies, academic institutions, and civil society organizations.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Multimodal Solution</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So what is the solution supply chain leaders are so badly seeking for sustainability efforts?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the same FourKites survey, 67% of respondents said the biggest struggle they had was end-to-end tracking of their goals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Luckily, Fourkites’ visibility platform provides the solution to reduce emissions and your carbon footprint, giving you the ability to understand and identify your waste through data.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customers can use the platform to </span><a href=\"https://www.fourkites.com/press/fourkites-introduces-supply-chain-sustainability-dashboard/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">see the environmental impact</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of their supply chain operations.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep Your Supply Chain Business Going for 20 More Years with Sustainability Plans</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emissions are a part of supply chain.

    "web_content": "<p>In a recent episode of the Let’s Talk Supply Chain podcast, I spoke about tech and sustainability’s influence on the freight industry and acquiring and retaining purpose-driven talent, the latter of which is my bread and butter.</p>\n<p>My people operations experience has taught me the powerful impact culture has on a company’s success. That’s the mindset I bring to my current role as senior vice president of people at <a href=\"https://www.flockfreight.com/home-page/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Flock Freight</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.flockfreight.com/about-us/careers/technology/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">technology company</a> that’s reducing waste and inefficiency by reinventing the supply chain. First to market with advanced algorithms that enable supply chain optimization by pooling shipments, Flock Freight creates a new standard of service for <a href=\"https://www.flockfreight.com/freight-shipping/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">shippers</a>, increases revenue for <a href=\"https://www.flockfreight.com/freight-carriers/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">carriers</a>, and eliminates the impact of carbon emissions through shared truckload service.</p>\n<p>Speedily transitioning from underdog startup to billion-dollar tech enterprise, Flock Freight gives me the unique opportunity to work with an ever-growing team that’s fundamentally changing the way freight moves. As we embark on a second year of doubling our workforce, it’s especially critical that we attract and retain the right talent, and preserve certain aspects of our evolving culture while welcoming unfamiliar changes.</p>\n<h2>Recruiting Culture Adds</h2>\n<p>Building a stellar team isn’t just about attracting the best candidates; it’s about hiring the right candidates for the right reasons. That’s where “culture add” versus “culture fit” comes into play.</p>\n<p>Culture fit is the practice of hiring candidates who look, think, act, and have similar backgrounds to your current team. It assumes your company has everything figured out and that all new hires need to do is fit in. Culture add, on the other hand, involves recognizing an opportunity to welcome candidates of other experiences and ideas. These additions may not have gone to the same schools or are not the same age as your current employees, but their diverse perspectives can enrich your culture.</p>\n<p>At Flock Freight, our customers and carrier partners are incredibly diverse, so the more diversity we have on our team, the better we are at understanding our stakeholders, anticipating their needs, and forming effective communication. If we can broaden our culture, we can broaden our stakeholder impact.</p>\n<h2>Fostering a High-Involvement Culture</h2>\n<p>In order to sustainably grow our team, we must retain employees and keep them happy. Fostering a positive work culture is the key to achieving that. Culture isn’t just up to human resources or the executive suite — it’s the employees who are in charge of employee culture.</p>\n<p>A high-involvement culture encourages and empowers employees to be active, conscious participants in employee culture. Employees should have avenues to be culture champions within organizations, and those avenues should have support from leadership and a budget behind them. At Flock Freight, this takes the form of five employee-run Impact teams focused on diversity and inclusion, the environment, employee engagement, community engagement, and philanthropy.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.flockfreight.com/about-us/careers/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Flock Freight grows</a>, our culture evolves organically, and as a people operations team, it’s our responsibility to help shape and guide it. We do that in part by recognizing and rewarding employees who exhibit our five core values: All in, Do the right thing, Empower others, Be agile, and Think big.</p>\n<p>I encourage other companies who want to foster a positive culture to find the people within your organization who care about it. Don&#8217;t look to your HR team — they care about it by definition — look to your other teams and get those folks to share their time and expertise. Engaged employees will often come up with better thoughts and solutions than any HR team. Also, gauge how your employees feel about your culture by utilizing surveys — an invaluable tool every company should use. Ask your employees how you’re doing, and when you find areas of opportunity in your company culture, go to employee groups to source solutions — don’t just wait for your HR department to fix it.</p>\n<h2>About the Author</h2>\n<p><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-12142 alignleft\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Melina-Fairleigh-Headshot-Square-Sandy-Athniel-300x292.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"292\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Melina-Fairleigh-Headshot-Square-Sandy-Athniel-300x292.jpg 300w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Melina-Fairleigh-Headshot-Square-Sandy-Athniel-1024x998.jpg 1024w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Melina-Fairleigh-Headshot-Square-Sandy-Athniel-768x748.jpg 768w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Melina-Fairleigh-Headshot-Square-Sandy-Athniel-1536x1496.jpg 1536w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Melina-Fairleigh-Headshot-Square-Sandy-Athniel-2048x1995.jpg 2048w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Melina-Fairleigh-Headshot-Square-Sandy-Athniel-600x585.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></p>\n<p>Melina Fairleigh is the senior vice president of people at Flock Freight, a technology company that’s reducing waste and inefficiency by reinventing the supply chain.

    "web_content": "<p>I know what you’re thinking. You’ve just gone through 2 years of hell trying to plug the holes in your supply chain through the disruption that will go unnamed, and now I’m talking about new technology? You’ve heard of “low-code” applications over the past couple years, but what exactly does that mean in supply chain and why is it essential? In any case, you’ve already committed millions for EPR upgrades that will not only consume most of your IT budget, but also keep your IT staff fully occupied for the rest of the year, so low code is not on your radar. This is a mistake.</p>\n<p>The truth is, low code applications are already all over yours, and everyone else’s, company. In the past, it’s been called “shadow IT”—you know, the applications that actually run your business. Many of these applications are run using what is called the Lingua Franca of business—Excel. As you undoubtedly know (as well as over 1B other users), there’s simply no better data environment (a grid of cells) on which you can model out virtually any supply chain, or other, business application. Forecasts, trackers, pricing, inventory, promotions, projects, production plans—the list of applications is endless.</p>\n<p>Your “citizen developers,” otherwise known as your subject matter experts who know your business and its processes, have relied on Excel for years. Supply chain is no exception. In fact, 68% of companies with supply chain operations use Excel spreadsheets as the primary technology for planning, despite the fact that 92% of these companies already have supply chain planning applications (2021 Supply Chain Insights Global Conference). And, this continues even with the familiar problems with Excel – emailing or file shares, silos of data, error prone, who made the last change, what version are we on, is the data in the Excel file accurate, etc. Given that Gartner predicts that by 2024, more than 65% of application development activity will be low code, wouldn’t it be nice to find a low-code application platform that leverages all this process IP that you already have in Excel?</p>\n<p>Enter <a href=\"https://www.boardwalktech.com/products/planning-apps#contact-us\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Boardwalktech</a>. For over 15 years, we’ve been working with Fortune 500 companies helping them scale applications they run manually in Excel today with a patented, cloud Digital Ledger database platform. With an authoring platform that runs in Excel and uses your Excel-based process IP “as-is” (yes, including formula logic), you can go from manually collaborating via email or a file share to automatically sharing cell-level changes via an “Excel” cloud database. All this, while retaining the flexibility of Excel and gaining the power and scalability of a cloud database. Imagine, being able to share data from inside Excel with other users with a click. To have data from one Excel process flow into another. To gain visibility across all your Excel-based activity. To understand how all this data changes over time to power more insightful machine learning and predictive analytics. While at the same time, reducing your time spent chasing data by 75% helping you get to the right decision, faster. And, there’s more. The Boardwalk Digital Ledger works with unstructured data bringing all your enterprise data together via a powerful control tower.</p>\n<p>Just think about how many applications are run manually in Excel today in your company—it’s time to turn this into a competitive advantage. Only by using a low-code application platform that directly leverages your Excel-based process IP without forcing you to recode it into another application, can you then be part of the 450 million low-code apps Microsoft says will be built over the next 5 years. The time to start is today.</p>\n<p>Get started today by joining our spreadsheet challenge. It costs nothing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>About the Author</h2>\n<p><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-12113 alignleft\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/jb-photo-JB-Kuppe-224x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"224\" height=\"300\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/jb-photo-JB-Kuppe-224x300.jpg 224w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/jb-photo-JB-Kuppe.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 224px) 100vw, 224px\" /> JB Kuppe is the SVP of Sales/CMO at Boardwalktech which has developed a patented Digital Ledger Technology low code application platform (LCAP) currently used by Fortune 500 companies running mission-critical applications worldwide.</p>\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewNumberedItemContainer\" role=\"listitem\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsItemItem\" data-required=\"true\" data-input=\"L9xHkb\" data-item-id=\"1609135432\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsItemItemHeader\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsItemItemTitleDescContainer\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsItemItemTitleContainer\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n",

Businesses that are able to embrace their client’s challenges and provide them affordable solutions are the ones that keep people coming back, and that’s exactly what RSI has done. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their keen eye for risk management and focus on collaboration makes them a great ally for any company of any size. And here at Let’s Talk Supply Chain, you know you can count on me to bring you the best solutions and my honest opinion. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s explore RSI’s mission and see what kind of companies can best manage their inventory with their technology.</span></p>\n<p><b>RSI’s mission is simple, but critically important in the supply chain world.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They exist for the sole purpose of providing the best inventory-optimization tool on the market that companies of any size can afford. </span></p>\n<p><b>What’s so special about RSI?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through predictive analytics, using AI, simulation, and machine learning, RSI is breaking free of outdated algorithms and calculations. As a result, the inventory settings are accurate because they account for all environmental supply chain factors, which traditional inventory planning systems can&#8217;t do. Also, their technology is complementary to any planning system (e.g. SAP, Oracle, Epicor, etc.) and does not displace existing investments, but instead enhances them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For these reasons, RSI&#8217;s technology is the most comprehensive tool on the market. </span></p>\n<p><b>What types of companies or people can benefit from RSI’s Technology?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It doesn&#8217;t matter what industry vertical or size of company you&#8217;re in, any company that needs to hold inventory to run their business can benefit from this inventory optimization solution.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rightsizedinventory.com/news/our-mission-and-the-characteristics-of-the-clients-we-support\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their clients</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> range from Fortune 50 companies to small mom-and-pop shops!

    "web_content": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a recent discussion on the </span><a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s Talk Supply Chain</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> podcast, Shabsie Levy talked about the pivotal role of technology in improving the efficiency of supply chain operations. In early 2019, Levy started </span><a href=\"https://shifl.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shifl</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a digital freight forwarding platform that leverages technology integration to navigate bottlenecks, reduce delays, increase transparency, and improve visibility across the supply chain. Combining the digital automation experience with personnel representative support in multiple locations across the globe, </span><a href=\"https://shifl.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shifl</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> seamlessly supports small and big customers in their freight operations. Its future vision is to create a freight ecosystem that enables its customers to do business without worrying about logistics management.</span></p>\n<p><b>How Shifl helps customers stay connected with updates</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Levy’s previous experiences in the industry helped him gain insight into bottlenecks such as delays in receiving important shipping updates that slow down operations. Shifl has now evolved into a solution that bridges the gap between the customer’s need to stay updated and real-time updates from ground zero. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shifl provides its customers with the latest status updates at every step along the way, from the time the purchase order is placed to when the shipment is delivered. Using live statuses gathered from tracking systems, their software helps customers stay updated with the latest piece of information. By doing this, Shifl empowers its customers to make informed decisions and operate their businesses efficiently, even during challenging times. </span></p>\n<p><b>How Shifl’s flexible payment options help customers stay afloat during tough times</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of </span><a href=\"https://shifl.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shifl’s</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> most unique offerings is that it allows its customers to pay with a credit card without imposing processing fees. When shipping rates go up, smaller businesses often struggle to arrange the sudden cash flow required to keep their businesses going. The burden of shouldering credit processing fees along with sky-high freight costs puts added pressure on them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Providing flexible payment options to customers lets them continue their operations without having to incur extra costs to keep going. Customers also receive the added flexibility to float an average of 40-45 days between multiple credit cards. This gives them ample support to keep their business going till things ease and the cash flow comes in. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Levy also pointed out how they went the extra mile to help their customers by talking to insurance companies to get some customers approved for higher credit limits during the last two years when the industry saw some of the highest container rates.</span></p>\n<p><b>How technology integration works at Shifl</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the heart of </span><a href=\"https://shifl.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shifl’s</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> core operations is its aim to reduce the disconnect in the industry and harness technology to integrate various systems. Levy explained how the platform functions as a central hub of information. APIs allow it to integrate data from third-party systems into its database and give out data to feed into a different system. For instance, Shifl has partnered with Terminal 49 to receive accurate container and ocean freight tracking data that it can relay to its customers. Additionally, it uses this information to create automation tools and strengthen its integration with third-party systems. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This being said, Levy and his team still have to overcome a lot of challenges to make Shifl a full-service solution. Smaller companies don’t possess API technology even today. Handling complex shipment scenarios such as less-container-load (LCL) shipments are complicated. There are a lot of such scenarios where 100% automation is still not possible. In such cases, </span><a href=\"https://shifl.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shifl </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">uses manual intervention to sustain. With its manual tracking team constantly gathering updates, Shifl continues to serve its customers across complex scenarios.</span></p>\n<p><b>How future technology integrations at Shifl will help improve customer experience</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alongside the services it offers, Shifl continues to grow with Levy and their team accelerating ideas and turning their future visions for the company to reality. Levy’s ultimate vision is to create a complete freight ecosystem that lets its customers do their business without worrying about logistics management. In the coming months, Levy and his team are adding tools with greater features for its customers to forecast industry trends, have a detailed look inside inventories, and integrate eCommerce with their platform. </span></p>\n<h2>About the Author</h2>\n<p><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-10881 alignleft\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/technology-integration-with-shifl-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/technology-integration-with-shifl-300x200.jpg 300w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/technology-integration-with-shifl-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/technology-integration-with-shifl-768x512.jpg 768w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/technology-integration-with-shifl-600x400.jpg 600w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/technology-integration-with-shifl.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" />Shabsie is the Founder and CEO of Shifl.

The one constant has been disruption, and we’ve seen it everywhere — from computer chip shortages to a truck driver employment crisis. But there’s one area that has everyone’s attention, and that’s shipping.</p>\n<p>The level of port congestion has been unprecedented, as has the two-fold issue with containers: the sheer volume we’ve seen either <a href=\"https://www.fourkites.com/blogs/ocean-shipping-in-turmoil-3-lessons-from-zim-kingston-disruption/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">going overboard</a> or lying uncollected or abandoned in ports across the world. And this has, of course, led to higher costs for companies as well as consumers and, increasingly, empty store shelves.</p>\n<p>Managing the current shipping crisis has become priority number one, with President Joe Biden announcing <a href=\"https://cheddar.com/media/breaking-down-the-24-7-port-of-la-deal-and-supply-chain-bottleneck\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">24/7 operations</a> at the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach in an effort to clear the backlog in the run-up to the holidays.</p>\n<p>I truly hope it helps, but I question if simply throwing more manpower at the crisis is the right thing to do. It feels like trying to reattach a limb with a band-aid! I don’t think the solution lies in working harder; it’s about working smarter.</p>\n<p>FourKites, the world’s leading real-time supply chain visibility platform, is bringing that ethos to the industry. The company recently announced <a href=\"https://www.fourkites.com/press/fourkites-expands-its-market-leading-ocean-visibility-platform-with-industry-first-dynamic-eta%ef%b8%8f-for-ocean-shipping-and-new-tools-to-manage-demurrage-and-detention/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">AI-powered enhancements to its Dynamic Ocean solution</a>, enabling it to provide ETAs that are up to 40% more accurate than carrier-generated ETAs. Up to 40%!   that could have at the ports. That increased accuracy can help prevent port congestion and better predict waiting times, reducing air pollution and fuel consumption. It can help better allocate resources and avoid conflicts which, in turn, could help with the current labor shortages. And ultimately, this will lead to increased efficiency and transparency in the global supply chain. Sounds good, right?</p>\n<p>And to support their Dynamic Ocean solution, FourKites have also rolled out a new suite of demurrage and detention tools that provide customers with an early warning solution and actionable insights, replacing the manual and/or spreadsheet-driven approaches used by most shippers. And if you’re a regular listener to the podcast, you’ll know just how necessary it is to get shippers out of Excel and into the future!</p>\n<p>These new capabilities mean that FourKites now provides <em>the</em> most advanced and robust solution on the market for <a href=\"https://www.fourkites.com/platform/ocean-freight-visibility/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">real-time and predictive ocean visibility</a>, exception management and cost controls, giving shippers the powerful capabilities to effectively manage and mitigate rising transportation costs during a time of constant upheaval.</p>\n<p>This all goes to show that visibility is a vital piece in helping to solve the supply chain puzzle — not a passing trend. Gartner, the leading research and advisory firm who <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/fourkites-continues-to-push-the-envelope-as-its-named-a-leader-in-gartners-magic-quadrant-for-real-time-transportation-visibility-platforms/\">named FourKites a Leader</a> in its Spring 2021 report, said that visibility is a top priority for supply chain leaders. And that demand for supply chain visibility has continued to increase in all modes, including requests for more insight and connection across international and multimodal shipments.</p>\n<p>Because visibility isn’t just about looking on a map and seeing dots that represent your freight in transit. That insight and connection needs to go completely end-to-end — and ideally integrated into one single platform — to achieve the impact and improvements we all need. Businesses need to see where their containers are at port, in the yard, warehouse, stores and beyond. By gaining high levels of multimodal visibility, businesses can benefit in so many ways, from achieving higher levels of ETA accuracy and optimizing fuel consumption, to mitigating transportation risks and reducing carbon footprint. The importance of multimodal visibility cannot be overstated.</p>\n<p>Gartner’s claims that demand for this level of supply chain visibility is increasing is reinforced by data from the FourKites platform. Over the last 12 months, FourKites has seen 450% growth in ocean loads tracked, and 40% growth quarter over quarter. Since launching Dynamic Ocean in April 2021, which covers 98% of global ocean shipments, 100% of terminals in North America and the majority of terminals in Europe, FourKites has seen a 50% increase in ocean visibility customers, including Yara International, International Forest Products and Zebra Technologies.</p>\n<p>So as demand increases, as well as disruption, it’s essential to have innovative and forward-thinking brands like FourKites. Their new Dynamic Ocean enhancements have come in direct response to the shipping crisis. It makes me proud to see a business that is so committed to bringing the industry into the future and to delivering solutions that make life easier for all of us.</p>\n<p>End-to-end visibility ultimately has the potential to create a more sustainable future and ensure a much smoother ride through the next, inevitable, set of disruptions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Find out more about FourKites’ <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/fourkites-combines-innovation-and-collaboration/\">approach to collaboration and innovation</a>, and their <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/collaboration-meets-visibility-why-fourkites-recent-funding-success-brings-supply-chain-one-step-closer-to-the-future/\">recent funding success</a>.</p>\n",

    "web_content": "<p>In the past two years, multiple lockdowns, port congestion and other such challenges have resulted in supply chain chaos worldwide.</p>\n<p>The industry has been facing unprecedented challenges, which are likely to continue well into 2022. In that light, here are 5 ways companies can prepare for the coming year.</p>\n<h2>1. Embrace digital transformation</h2>\n<p>Using the right technology, you can get a holistic view of your supply chain so you can act proactively, mitigate risks and make more informed decisions. The time is now to adapt by embracing digital transformation. And this doesn’t have to cost an exorbitant amount &#8211; the technology to help already exists, and is both cost-effective and easy to implement.</p>\n<h2>2. Diversify your ecosystem</h2>\n<p>Though unfortunate, it’s common for disruptions such as natural disasters, port closures, product shortages &#8211; and nowadays COVID variants &#8211; to pop up and negatively affect your supply chain. To enable flexibility and minimize disruptions to your supply chain you should diversify. Have a supply chain that involves multiple suppliers and partners across a range of local, regional, and global locations to support operations.</p>\n<h2>3. Sustainable sourcing</h2>\n<p>The fashion industry is responsible for about 10% of the world’s carbon emissions. COP26 has highlighted the need for the industry to be more sustainable. We imagine this will be a huge focus in the next year. Fashion companies will need to know the provenance of their products and how they are made. Sustainable sourcing will also be a key priority. With regulators and consumers demanding more transparency, companies who are proactive will have a competitive edge.</p>\n<h2>4. Overcome silo mentality</h2>\n<p>The apparel industry is notoriously opaque and fragmented. In order to achieve true transparency, businesses and the wider industry have to break down silos. Without information-sharing amongst key departments in a company,  it’s difficult for any business to have a complete picture and act quickly to take advantage of new opportunities.</p>\n<h2>5. Measure what matters</h2>\n<p>There’s a significant amount of data held across systems. Technology can help consolidate and analyze this data to provide powerful insights. For example, they can help identify inefficiencies in their supply chain, or drive performance against KPIs by learning from historic trends.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>About the Author</h2>\n<p><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-10764 alignleft\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/serai-trade-300x298.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"298\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/serai-trade-300x298.jpg 300w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/serai-trade-150x150.jpg 150w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/serai-trade-60x60.jpg 60w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/serai-trade-600x596.jpg 600w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/serai-trade-100x100.jpg 100w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/serai-trade.jpg 611w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lindseyhermes\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lindsey Hermes</a> is a professional in the digital B2B world.</p>\n",

    "web_content": "<p>Greg Braun recently had a chance to discuss the history of dock and yard management at C3 Solutions and how those innovations are giving rise to a new age of logistics efficiency on the <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/podcast/\"> Let’s Talk Supply Chain Podcast.</a> C3 Solutions is not a new company by far, but their innovations are driving a new standard for efficiency in dock and yard management without the high costs of building an in-house platform and leveraging APIs and technology to calm the supply chain storm. Plus, he shared some great news regarding future developments for driver-enabled, proactive controls that will further the causes of efficient dock and yard management too. Here are some of the highlights from that conversation.</p>\n<h2>C3 Solutions’ Products for Dock and Yard Management Technology Live Within the Same Platform.</h2>\n<p>Braun explained how much of the value of C3 Solutions and the innovations driving the industry come from a unified system infrastructure. For example, some customers may not need much dock scheduling, but they may rely heavily on drop-and-hook programs, creating complexity and confusion in their yards. That’s where C3 Solutions can bring order to chaos by optimizing the yard drivers, planning trailer moves, and continuing to create an orchestra of in-yard moves.</p>\n<h2>C3 Dock Scheduling Helps Leaders Throttle Docks When Necessary.</h2>\n<p>Part of the benefit of C3 Solutions Dock Management is the ability to set a maximum number of appointments based on different rulesets. For instance, setting a specific number of appointments on Monday versus fewer on Wednesday when staff are otherwise busy. Once that plan has been added to the software, the system becomes automatic, giving carriers and suppliers the ability to self-schedule appointments and lessening the workload of dock teams and management. If the schedule does get out of hand, such as unplanned supplier’s arrival, or an error on the part of the carrier, managers could also use the software to throttle new booking to ensure staff can safely unload and put away freight.</p>\n<p>Now, the software alleviates the concerns over miscommunications in appointment scheduling, and even if something is overlooked, users can set alerts to help everyone stay informed and ready when appointments draw near. The same capabilities can be applied to improve transparency into warehouse receiving, eliminating manual status calls to find out if freight has arrived, which leads naturally into improved inventory transparency for e-commerce and omnichannel customers.</p>\n<p>But going back to that unexpected or late arrival. If the driver’s going to be late, the software is evolving to give drivers a way to check-in in advance. This includes sharing the GPS location in real-time, which will reduce delays at the gate and help avoid issues with flexing the dock schedule to accommodate changes.</p>\n<p>However, that advancement is really the tip of the iceberg. If drivers have a way to inform warehouses of potential changes in ETA automatically, the warehouse could conceivably increase appointments to fill blank slots, and drivers can avoid excess wait time. This becomes a win-win scenario for both drivers and warehouses.</p>\n<h2>What About Innovation in the Yard?</h2>\n<p>The yard management solution at C3 Solutions was designed for scalability, and it’s that scalability that helps companies go from an SMB to a competitor to Amazon and major companies. This is also true in managing shipments that are not necessarily full truckload, for instance, allowing companies to plan partial truckload loading/unloading and turning more locations into hub-like centers. But yard management and dock management go hand-in-hand, and ironically, many yard management users at C3 Solutions don’t necessarily rely on the dock scheduling software.</p>\n<p>The integration between that user’s TMS and the C3 platform itself can be used to naturally improve dock management by reducing confusion in the yard, even if that means parking at the dock itself. In this fashion, yard management blends seamlessly into dock management.</p>\n<p>C3 Solutions has also used its technology to help reduce empty backhauls by giving shippers insight into their total moves, including those where dunnage, supplier equipment, such as pallets and crates, can be tracked in the trailer and accounted for in the movement of goods. Thus, the whole process grows in transparency and is able to be completed faster. Such advances have an additional implication for managing sensitive goods, such as groceries moving in reefer or items that require a strong chain-of-custody, like pharmaceuticals.</p>\n<h2>The Big Picture</h2>\n<p>C3 Solutions started with in-house software that became a go-to solution for companies that needed a better strategy for managing the dock and yard.

    "web_content": "<h2>Tackle Supply Uncertainty with these Five Planning Strategies</h2>\n<p>Supply delays, logistics constraints and inflation, oh my! It’s the story of our lives today, as the enormous bullwhip effect of COVID continues. Much of the world has moved past lockdowns and are demanding finished products from their usual suppliers; but dwindling cargo space, skyrocketing transportation costs and component delays make it difficult to keep shelves stocked. Here are five ways you can minimize supply risk while still meeting your business objectives with smart supply chain planning.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong> Put Your Available Inventory to the Best Use</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Chances are you do have <em>some</em> inventory&#8211;make sure it’s being put to the best use. This is where an advanced supply chain planning system can really shine, by allocating the stock you have on hand according to your business goals, e.g. profitability, sales maximization or others. In more buoyant times, more companies may be optimizing to reduce cost or maximize revenue to grab market share. In the current climate, with severe supply shortages, companies are interested in optimizing for margin. You can also detect and correct possible stock imbalances by re-distributing excess stock in the network to other locations.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong> Get Your Product Portfolio in Shape</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>When COVID hit, manufacturers scrambled to meet demand, but there was a nasty surprise in store in the form of a radical shift in consumer buying patterns and behaviors. However, this demand shift presents a unique opening to rethink your product portfolio and rationalize it to ensure you’re focused on the more critical subsets. Here are some places to get started:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify the products that are surging in demand versus dwindling</li>\n<li>Determine the strategic value of each product in your portfolio</li>\n<li>Assess potential opportunities to collaborate with business partners to bring new products to market</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong> Re-evaluate What You’re Ordering</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>There’s no guarantee that the supply you normally order will be available, so it pays to be smart about what you order to maximize service and profitability.</p>\n<p>Analyze which supply orders will contribute to higher margin sales, which are most likely to sell, or what’s needed to fulfill backorders quickly. You can also evaluate equivalent items that may be good substitutes for those in short supply. You may be low on Item A, but Item B is an equivalent alternative item available to order. Of course, this tactic is ideal for lower margin, commodity type items&#8211;not for higher margin, specialized items.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong> Stress-Test Your Supply Chain with S&amp;OP Scenarios </strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Scenario planning is nothing new to businesses, but when a major disruption occurs, it’s both highly and newly relevant. One of the ways to ensure your supply chain is ready for the next crisis is to test its resiliency by leveraging S&amp;OP. With the right simulation tool in place, your S&amp;OP team can make “on-the-fly” calculations to show the supply chain and P&amp;L impacts for a variety of scenarios including the impact of price increases, promotions, purchasing requirements, and production plans. You can also create new scenarios to address inbound import shipments stuck in ports with parts, components or finished goods by shifting suppliers from Asia to other locations&#8211;the possibilities are truly limitless.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong> Try Production Planning to Adapt to Supply Changes</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The impact of current material shortages is compelling companies to re-evaluate their production strategy. You can use production planning to adjust to uncertain supply by pre-purchasing supplier bill-of-materials components with the longest lead times, partnering with suppliers to identify components with the extended lead times or high supply uncertainty, and much more.</p>\n<p><strong>Need practical guidance for building a supply chain that’s ready for anything? </strong>Download the eBook, <a href=\"https://www.toolsgroup.com/resources/ebook-supply-chain-disruptions/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Game On: A Planner’s Playbook for Rapid Response to Supply Chain Disruptions</strong></a>.</p>\n<p><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-9770 alignleft\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/toolsgroup-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/toolsgroup-300x300.jpg 300w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/toolsgroup-150x150.jpg 150w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/toolsgroup-768x765.jpg 768w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/toolsgroup-600x597.jpg 600w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/toolsgroup-100x100.jpg 100w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/toolsgroup.jpg 888w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" />Bobby Miller is Sr. Director of Customer Success at <strong><a href=\"https://www.toolsgroup.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ToolsGroup</a></strong>, where he works with customers to maximize their results and progress in their supply chain planning maturity.

    "web_content": "<p dir=\"ltr\">True: The supply chain is the lifeline of many companies and is key for operational success.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Also true: Only 10% of supply chain professionals feel extremely prepared for future disruptions, according to a recent survey.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In today’s ever-changing world, disruptions are inevitable – in fact, 79% of supply chain professionals deal with unanticipated changes on a daily or weekly basis. The future state of supply chain operations needs to be built on a culture of visibility and collaboration across teams – meaning organizations must commit to continuously evaluating and working to break down organizational silos with a methodical change management process.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Why is it so hard to react to change in the first place?</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In our survey of supply chain professionals, respondents pointed to manual processes (39%), disconnected systems (20%), lack of insight (19%), and fluctuating priorities and regulations (18%) as major hang-ups when responding to change.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This was only accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, and 54% of survey respondents cited increasing visibility as a supply chain priority. So, what should organizations do to increase their operational agility when it comes to responding to change?</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Prioritize Collaboration and Automation</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Organizations need to rethink existing supply chain practices and technological abilities to prioritize transparency and resilience. This can be achieved by automating formerly manual processes, which provides better visibility for teams whether it be order management, inventory or procurement processes. Not to mention, it will be much easier to meet customer demands and maintain customer satisfaction and a competitive edge.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Gaining more visibility across the organization ultimately gives all contributors within the wider supply chain network insight into what is happening when, providing more informed decisions and faster reaction times.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Centralizing unique processes and operational data is an essential practice to allow teams the ability to streamline execution in previously siloed environments.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Invest in Agile Technology to Strengthen Core Systems</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To extend the use cases of core systems, organizations need to add a layer of agility on top of existing environments. For supply chain teams, this can come with a no-code agility layer to unite data and systems and remove tedious, risky manual processes. For example, an organization can digitize multiple supplier operations processes in a single environment. From onboarding and audits to corrective action planning and KPI tracking, all interrelated pieces can be managed and customized in a single tool chain.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These added layers of agility serve a dual purpose by empowering business users to create their own solutions and automated processes all without the cost and time of a traditional approach while maintaining the scale, security and governance features required. With Quickbase specifically, organizations highlight the speed with which they can stand up systems and unite data.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a result, this gives teams unique opportunities to identify, escalate and resolve their own issues quickly and efficiently as well as adapt their processes as changes occur in the business. By adopting the right technology and giving business users that are closest to the work more direct control over their workflows and processes, organizations are better prepared to solve issues timely and effectively.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Conclusion</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Supply chain resilience must be improved for companies to not just survive but thrive in our ever-changing world. This can be made possible by increasing visibility into workflows that must be executed in collaboration between a manufacturer and supplier and automating manual tasks slowing the process down. Increasing transparency and agility within your operations in tandem with the right tools will allow you to adapt quickly, safely and effectively to changing circumstances.</p>\n<h2>About the Author</h2>\n<p><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-7795 size-medium alignleft\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Peter_Quickbase-Helen-Byrne-300x300-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" title=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewNumberedItemContainer\" role=\"listitem\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsItemItem freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextTextItem\" data-required=\"true\" data-item-id=\"254210850\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextTextItemContainer\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextLongText freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextDisabledText freebirdThemedInput\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterrifken/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Rifken</a> is a Solutions Principal &amp; Consultant at <a href=\"https://www.quickbase.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Quickbase</a> based in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

It’s a highly competitive market where margins are razor-thin. The majority of costs are associated with transportation vendors and the customer service team, so maintaining profitability relies heavily on customer service productivity and establishing beneficial terms with supply chain partners.</p>\n<p>A freight forwarder focuses on selling value-added services to differentiate in the marketplace and improve margins, and facilitates a high volume of shipments to maximize net profit dollars.</p>\n<h2>Challenges Abound</h2>\n<p>In this highly competitive market, on-time and in-full delivery is the benchmark by which freight forwarders are measured. Consumers demand instant access to the status of their shipments. Similarly, supply chain partners rely on real-time updates and precise ETAs to avoid demurrage and detention charges that could easily add up to thousands of dollars.</p>\n<p>Traditionally, this freight forwarder’s customer service team manually retrieves status updates from each ocean line’s track-and trace board, then relays that information to customers and supply chain partners. This presents a number of challenges:</p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">A time-consuming, arduous process. Team members could spend an entire workday collecting data on thousands of containers. That’s time that could be spent focusing on customer service and growing the business.</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">Manual entry increases the likelihood of errors.</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">Lack of clean, standardized data. Track-and-trace boards offer varying levels of granularity.</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">Lack of timeliness. Relying on track-and-trace boards delays the flow information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The freight forwarder needs a solution that solves these challenges because consumers have a choice in providers, and they won’t hesitate to switch to a freight forwarder that can satisfy their needs.</p>\n<h2>Solution: Automated Container Status Updates through API</h2>\n<p>Freight forwarders can utilize Vizion APIs to automate business processes, improve their customer experience, reduce transportation costs, and make informed, data-driven decisions.</p>\n<p>Customers can subscribe to the container(s) transporting their goods and have carrier reported events automatically posted to their account profile through our Ocean Freight Tracking API. Upon subscription to a container, customers would have the ability to opt-in to automated exception alerts delivered through our Exception Alert API or view the location of their goods in real time through our AIS Vessel Data and Enhanced Location add-ons.These features can improve the overall customer experience while eliminating menial tasks traditionally performed by customer service personnel.</p>\n<p>All cleansed and standardized shipment details are stored in a database. By analyzing the past performance of ocean carrier partners, the freight forwarder can leverage their data to reduce costs associated with demurrage, detention and ocean freight rates.</p>\n<h2>The Results: Greater ROI, Operational Efficiency</h2>\n<p>By utilizing Vizion APIs, the freight forwarder made meaningful impacts to their profitability and customer satisfaction.</p>\n<p>The customer service team reduced time spent on menial tasks by 95% while improving their average support response time and the accuracy of reports. An enhanced level of service, which brought customer churn to a new low.</p>\n<p>Supply chain partners proactively managed demurrage and detention costs with their access to the most current and accurate ETAs, and the executive team analyzed SSL trends to negotiate a rate structure that will incrementally improve average costs.</p>\n<h2>By the Numbers:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>793% Return on Investment</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">46 Day Payback Period</li>\n<li>(793% is a ~year 2 ROI based on Vizion assumptions; individual results would vary depending on company-specific inputs)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Discover the Power of Vizion API Technology</h2>\n<p>Providing modern <a href=\"https://vizionapi.com/container-tracking\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">APIs</a> for tracking 98% of ocean shipments globally.

    "web_content": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The supply chain industry has undoubtedly faced some of its toughest challenges in the past 18 months, and there’s a lot of talk that the industry has been transformed forever. But that, at least in part, is not necessarily a bad thing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Innovation in supply chain is at an all-time high, as big brands and entrepreneurs alike get creative to develop new solutions to old problems and innovate fresh ways to push the industry into the future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our friends over at FourKites, the world’s premier real-time supply chain visibility platform, are once again leading the way. After months of hard work, FourKites recently announced that it’s been awarded a groundbreaking </span><a href=\"https://www.fourkites.com/press/fourkites-awarded-patent-for-ai-powered-eta-using-smart-forecasted-arrival-engine/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">US Patent for its Smart Forecasted Arrival (SFA) capabilities</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which provide companies with highly frequent and accurate ETAs for freight in transit — even when that truck lacks any technology to transmit location data. That’s a game-changer, right? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Visibility is the word on everyone’s lips right now as businesses across the industry continue to recognize its potential for helping to transform pretty much every part of the supply chain. Still, a major obstacle to realizing visibility’s maximum potential is legacy IT systems and equipment. As a result, even as companies worldwide accelerate their investments in real-time transportation visibility platforms to better track and manage their freight in transit, they’ve repeatedly been hindered by the loads that still couldn’t be tracked. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FourKites’ SFA solution solves this huge issue by applying cutting-edge artificial neural networking and machine learning technologies to the industry’s largest supply chain data network. This, in turn, allows it to interpolate the location of freight in transit based on other data from within the network, </span><b>ultimately providing ETAs on 97% of untracked loads with 85% accuracy, and correctly predicting late loads more than 90% of the time</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Now that just blows my mind and, having worked for many years in 3PL’s and now in the maritime space, I can’t overstate just how beneficial this is going to be, industry-wide. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But innovation isn’t just about the tech. For me, innovation is just as much about culture and mindset. As FourKites’ new SFA platform shows, you can’t hope to pioneer new developments and achieve meaningful breakthroughs with a siloed approach or dated mentality. Collaboration, and all of the wonderful things it brings along with it, from creative thinking and problem-solving opportunities to access to data and diverse expertise, is what creates the environment that nurtures innovation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FourKites is no stranger to the collaborative side of innovation, either. In addition to their new patent announcement, they’ve also announced a new </span><a href=\"https://www.fourkites.com/blogs/empowering-brokers-and-carriers-through-real-time-visibility-data/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">strategic partnership with DAT Freight &amp; Analytics</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, North America’s largest marketplace for truckload freight. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Access to real-time visibility data has proven to lower organizations’ operating costs, improve on-time performance and enable stronger customer relationships, and DAT plans to capitalize on this, through their new collaboration, to bring a host of benefits to their brokers and customers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The partnership will provide valuable new insight into the status of loads from dock to dock, predictive ETAs and wait time information, improved customer service, strengthened relationships with carriers, quick integration of tracking apps and so much more.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DAT President and CEO, Claude Pumilia, said they chose to partner with FourKites because of their </span><b>“market-leading data quality and proven ability to break down barriers to data-sharing and collaboration”</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and those really are the magic words. Back in the day, this kind of data-sharing and collaboration was unheard of – it was a negative, in fact. Businesses worked hard to achieve what was theirs, and they wanted to protect it, building high walls around it. If you have that kind of attitude in 2021 and beyond, it’s guaranteed to be the death of your business. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Matt Elenjickal, FourKites founder and CEO says that their “goal is to empower every broker and carrier with high-quality visibility data so they can enhance equipment utilization, increase productivity and run an efficient, sustainable freight network,” and I truly can’t think of a better goal for individual businesses, nor for the industry as a whole. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find out more about FourKites’ </span><a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/collaboration-meets-visibility-why-fourkites-recent-funding-success-brings-supply-chain-one-step-closer-to-the-future/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recent funding success</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and why </span><a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/fourkites-continues-to-push-the-envelope-as-its-named-a-leader-in-gartners-magic-quadrant-for-real-time-transportation-visibility-platforms/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gartner named them a leader</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in its latest Magic Quadrant report. </span></p>\n",

    "web_content": "<p>While it took a year of unprecedented disruption, the C-suite is now putting a strong focus on supply chain resiliency and developing a digital supply chain. CEOs and CFOs no longer view the supply chain as just a business function that mainly operates in the background. They see it as essential to reduce organizational risk and drive competitive advantage.</p>\n<p>There was initial hope that 2021 would bring about a full return to normalcy. But now, many business leaders are approaching the remainder of 2021 with caution. Although vaccines are rolling out and restrictions are being lifted, COVID-19 disruptions are likely to continue throughout the year. And even when we finally break free from the grips of the pandemic, we know that another disruption — whether natural or political — is inevitable. Thus, supply chain scenario planning is essential.</p>\n<p>In December 2020, I wrote in an article for Business Chief where I stated that the supply chain would take center stage in the business agenda for this year. As we enter Q2 2021, we can see this playing out:</p>\n<p>• CFOs are taking a greater interest in how supply chains support business growth and reduce financial risk. The financial implications of supply chain disruption or inefficiency can be significant, with over 80% of a company’s costs tied up in the supply chain.</p>\n<p>• Technology will play an essential role in improving efficiency and managing risk. Advanced technologies like machine learning, artificial intelligence, and digital twins were once considered luxuries but are now required to remain competitive. This is highlighted in the Gartner Hype Cycle for Supply Chain Planning Technologies.</p>\n<p>• For the healthcare and life sciences industry, improvements will be imperative. This is an industry that is lagging behind others such as FMCG or high tech in terms of supply chain technology adoption. Yet, healthcare continues to be an industry that the world depends on, more than ever, in 2021.</p>\n<p>• Until responding to pandemic disruption became the primary focus, the most pressing priority for many companies was sustainability and pledges to be carbon neutral by 2030. That goal may now need to compete with the need to achieve greater end-to-end visibility across the supply chain to identify vulnerabilities and risks. However, by achieving visibility, organizations can more accurately identify the inefficiencies that contribute to CO2 emissions and use these insights to make their supply chains more sustainable.</p>\n<p>2020 was the year that pre-existing supply chain rulebooks were thrown out. 2021 is shaping up to be the year where business models are adapted to new ways of working. If businesses want to survive and succeed in a world where one disruption replaces the next, resilience and agility, powered by the latest supply chain technology, will be crucial.</p>\n<h2>About the Author</h2>\n<p><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-7189 size-medium alignleft\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Madhav-Durbha_sq_600x600-Gina-Bing-300x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Madhav-Durbha_sq_600x600-Gina-Bing-300x300.png 300w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Madhav-Durbha_sq_600x600-Gina-Bing-100x100.png 100w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Madhav-Durbha_sq_600x600-Gina-Bing-150x150.png 150w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Madhav-Durbha_sq_600x600-Gina-Bing.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></p>\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewNumberedItemContainer\" role=\"listitem\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsItemItem freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextTextItem\" data-required=\"true\" data-item-id=\"254210850\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextTextItemContainer\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextLongText freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextDisabledText freebirdThemedInput\">Dr. Madhav Durbha is the Vice President of Supply Chain Strategy at <a href=\"https://www.coupa.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Coupa Software</a> helping customers and prospects solve various supply chain challenges.

If there are unexpected delays or something significant happens like the COVID-19 pandemic, everything is thrown into chaos.\n\nResponding to delays isn’t a new challenge for the transport industry, but over the past two years there have been two major events that have highlighted the flow-on effects that happen when global supply chains are disrupted. The first one is of course the pandemic, but perhaps the greatest visual example was when the 400 metre-long Ever Given vessel blocked the Suez Canal for six days in March.\n\nImporters and exporters who were affected still had the same major question they’ve always had – when will I get my goods to my warehouse or my customer? At 1-Stop Connections, our main purpose is to help our clients answer that question. We provide a logistics platform that helps move cargo more efficiently using data.\n\nIn a Ports environment for example, we enable operators to use data to make sure customs are clearing cargo, duties are being paid by the freight forwarder, security clearances are happening, manifesting is taking place and bookings are being made. This data allows the whole process to be streamlined so terminal operators can move boxes in and out of their port as quickly as possible.\n\nFrom the perspective of a transport operator, the exchange of data allows them to maximise the asset, plan their jobs and let the importers and exporters know exactly when they will get their goods. The 1-Stop platform connects businesses, large and small, through EDI, API or XML so that each operator is still operating in their own system, but knowing they are getting live information that is continually updated.\n\nThrough this sharing of data, 1-Stop has been able to save the Australian ports community in excess of AU$10 billion in productivity savings. This is because operators are able to see which box is arriving for which vessel at any time, so they can have automatic gates opening or closing and the right number of trucks and staff on site to manage the process.\n\nAll of this has a cascading effect to everyone in the supply chain, big or small. For example; truck turnaround times in Port Botany in Sydney went from six hours in 2005 down to less than half an hour after 1-Stop’s platform was implemented. If all components of the supply chain aren’t working in alignment, there is a lot of time wasted, and a lot of extra charges that are passed down throughout the supply chain to the end user.\n\nOne of the main reasons the supply chain is more efficient with 1-Stop’s platform is that a lot of the paperwork that can cause blockages on site, is actually processed days before. Data-sharing makes the process more efficient for drivers as well, if the cargo hasn’t arrived, and the paperwork isn’t done, transport operators can’t make a booking at the port. For the port operators using 1-Stop, we are able to reduce or eliminate the landside chaos through digitisation and automation so people operate with a plan that is predictable and reliable.\n\nFor me, the main channel for innovation in our industry is data-sharing. That’s why we don’t create operating systems for just one component of the supply chain, we work with each component to understand questions they need answered and the best approach to solve their challenges. Creating that process of data sharing allows everyone to determine capacity and manage workloads throughout the process. Once you put collaboration, integration and innovation together, you’re going to get efficiency.\n<h2>About the Author</h2>\n<img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-7200 size-medium alignleft\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mbweb4-1-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mbweb4-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mbweb4-1-600x900.jpg 600w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mbweb4-1-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mbweb4-1-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mbweb4-1-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mbweb4-1.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" />\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewNumberedItemContainer\" role=\"listitem\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsItemItem freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextTextItem\" data-required=\"true\" data-item-id=\"254210850\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextTextItemContainer\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextLongText freebirdFormviewerViewItemsTextDisabledText freebirdThemedInput\">\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michael Bouari is the CEO at <a href=\"https://www.1-stop.biz/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1-Stop Connections.</a></span>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewNumberedItemContainer\" role=\"listitem\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsItemItem\" data-required=\"true\" data-input=\"L9xHkb\" data-item-id=\"1609135432\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsItemItemHeader\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsItemItemTitleDescContainer\">\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewItemsItemItemTitleContainer\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</section>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t",

    "web_content": "<p>When we reflect on the impact of COVID on business, there are a few key themes that tend to crop up time and again. Risk management, the importance of collaboration, and agility – or the ability to pivot quickly in a crisis – are all areas that I’ve discussed on pretty much every podcast, webinar or event that I’ve been a part of over the last 18 months. And businesses that have embraced these core areas are the ones that have, not just survived, but thrived, during and post-pandemic.</p>\n<p>I love to hear about the brands that have mastered that combination successfully, and I know you do to. Because if us supply chain professionals are anything, it’s passionate and committed. We’re hungry for that learning, we want to soak up all the insights we can, and apply them to our own businesses.</p>\n<p>And that’s why the launch of Right Sized Inventory’s (RSI) new solution really stood out to me as a story we can all take a lot from.</p>\n<p>RSI’s technology is the most advanced and comprehensive predictive analytics inventory optimization tool on the market. Their solution simulates real-world supply chain environments to help their clients understand, analyze, manage, and optimize their inventory.</p>\n<p>But when the pandemic hit, supply chain professionals were overwhelmed – extra workload, additional responsibility, staff shortages, increased customer demand, delays, disruption… we all know that the list goes on and on. And in order to cope, people had to prioritize. Certain things you push down the list, certain things you adapt or take shortcuts… some things get cut out completely. And, although that approach can help you stay afloat in the short term, it can certainly introduce major risk and expose you and your business to bigger issues down the line.</p>\n<p>Early on in the crisis, RSI were having these conversations with their clients. They listened carefully to the challenges, heard these stories of juggling workloads and de-prioritization, identified the recurring issues, and it didn’t take long before they realized that inventory – specifically, being less stringent and raising inventory levels slightly above what’s needed to meet demand – was a key area of risk for their clients. Businesses were leaning towards this approach to inventory because they felt it was the path of least resistance in minimizing workload, but RSI knew only too well that it really isn’t the best path long term.</p>\n<p>So RSI developed a new service called Inventory-Optimization-as-a-Service (IOaaS). Instead of the, already overloaded, client performing – or indeed not performing! – inventory simulations with their software, RSI do it all on their behalf. The client simply provides the relevant data and RSI, utilizing all of their years of expertise, perform the necessary simulations and give an easy to use, actionable report back to the client so they can quickly and effectively achieve, and maintain, optimal inventory. It prevents time-poor clients from having to compromise and so deliver suboptimal results – and it’s gone down a storm. Because, of course, if time and manpower is short, and you can get the experts to tackle this key part of the puzzle at a fraction of the cost of employing someone in-house, why wouldn’t you? It’s a complete no-brainer.</p>\n<p>And what RSI have done is actually super smart. Because they developed a solution that brought optimal value and efficiency to their customers, but that also helped their own business to pivot in a time of crisis. RSI have said themselves, they never intended to be a service company. But through paying close attention to their clients challenges, they were shrewd enough to interpret how that risk extended to their own business. RSI anticipated how their every-day solution could easily be pushed down the priority list of these overworked supply chainers and they didn’t wait – they took action.</p>\n<p>This is the kind of story that just excites and inspires me so much. The collaboration at play here, the smart innovation and that much talked about agility is incredible. It’s just goes to show that if you’re committed to your clients, passionate about what you do and genuinely dynamic in your approach, you can create solutions that lift your clients up, that lift your business up – and that continues to deliver value all the way down the supply chain.</p>\n",

While it’s true that the process of getting products from one place to another will always be somewhat analogue, there is a wealth of data inherent to logistics that has the potential to strategically influence business decisions. Our space is the natural integration point between OMS, WMS, and TMS systems, which provides rich data sets that can and should be aggregated and analyzed with machine learning to mine out some really valuable information for merchants. There are five major ways that analyzing logistics data with machine learning will benefit merchants.</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Choosing warehouse placement according to geoproximity to largest customer bases, warehouse capacity, and required </span><a href=\"https://ware2go.co/warehousing/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">warehousing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or transportation capabilities.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Determining how much inventory merchants should be carrying and how it should be distributed. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Optimizing sku profiles by calling out highest and lowest performers based on profitability, rather than just sales velocity.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Determining when and how much product to reorder for optimal inventory carry costs and supplier bulk order discounts.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forecasting demand based on historical sales and patterns of seasonality. </span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At first glance these solutions may look like bottom-line revenue solutions, and on one hand they are. However, at Ware2Go we’ve seen first-hand that these solutions are also top-line revenue drivers. The problem of demand generation is one that marketers have long been trying to solve from the top-down, but the real secret to demand generation is having the right products in the right place at the right time. When you’ve solved that problem, all you have to do is let your customers know that the products they want can be on their doorstep in 1 to 2 days, and the demand will come.</span></p>\n<p><b>Saying Aloha to a New Sales Channel</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our client </span><a href=\"https://aloha.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aloha</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a plant-based protein brand, leveraged our AI-powered tool, </span><a href=\"https://ware2go.co/what-is-networkvu/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NetworkVu</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, to build their distributed network before they ramped up their direct-to-consumer sales channel.

They chose to create demand from the bottom-up by building a network that could deliver on that expectation before they ramped up their marketing efforts. The insights generated by NetworkVU showed them where their largest pockets of demand were located and where they needed to stock their inventory to best serve their customers, allowing them to offer 2-day delivery to 98% of their customers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aloha launched into their D2C marketing efforts with the confidence that they had their inventory in the right place to serve their customers at just the right time. As a result, they saw a tremendous ROI on the work they put into revamping and marketing their ecommerce website.

This is how businesses of all sizes can scale quickly and really expand their market share.</span></p>\n<p><b>Data Is the Future</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Network optimization is just the beginning for Ware2Go as we reimagine the traditional </span><a href=\"https://ware2go.co/what-is-3pl-guide\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3PL</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> model and find more meaningful ways to partner with our merchants.

In fact, it’s estimated that by 2023, 50% of global product-centric enterprises will have invested in real-time transportation visibility platforms.* Quite the change for an industry where legacy systems and juggling multiple Excel spreadsheets is still common.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So as businesses rush to get ahead of the pack and revolutionize their operations, who should they turn to for a </span><a href=\"https://www.fourkites.com/real-time-transportation-visibility-platforms/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">real-time transportation visibility platform (RTTVP)</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that delivers exactly what they need?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gartner, the leading research and advisory firm, has made this the subject of their </span><a href=\"https://www.fourkites.com/2021-gartner-magic-quadrant-for-real-time-transportation-visibility-platforms/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">latest Magic Quadrant report</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as they analyze the strengths and cautions of 14 leading RTTVPs. And it’s no surprise that FourKites, the #1 global supply chain visibility platform, was named a Leader in their report.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FourKites provides cloud-based visibility software solutions to shippers, carriers, 3PLs and freight brokers for predictive, real-time visibility across all modes. And FourKites completeness of vision has been heralded by Gartner as it continues to innovate, build strong industry partnerships and expand its offering in an impressive commitment to the ultimate goal of true end-to-end visibility. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Combining swift growth with strategic collaboration, FourKites broadened its offering from transportation and extended it beyond the gate to the yard when it acquired the YMS module from TrackX in 2020, to offer next-generation yard management on top of yard visibility, or </span><a href=\"https://www.fourkites.com/platform/yard-management/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dynamic Yard</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Moreover, FourKites recently acquired the YMS from Zebra, and created a partnership with Volvo Trucks, to integrate tracking off the assembly line, combine engine data with real-time transportation data like facilities and dwell time, and create a foundation for autonomous vehicles. These partnerships, in addition to FourKites’ recent </span><a href=\"https://www.fourkites.com/future-of-digital-supply-chains/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">big-name strategic partnerships</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with Volvo Group, Zebra Technologies and Qualcomm announced along with its Series D last month, are enough to turn heads as the industry rounds a pivotal corner and shifts into high gear.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Considering FourKites is less than 10 years old, having been founded in 2014, that completeness of vision and unwavering dedication to transforming the industry, to bring greater agility, efficiency and sustainability, is even more impressive. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This month, as it continues to pioneer the supply chain visibility category, FourKites announced new service-level agreements and an industry-first data tracking guarantee that, together, help customers achieve end-to-end supply chain visibility faster and with higher quality. FourKites’ new </span><a href=\"https://www.fourkites.com/press/fourkites-introduces-carrier-connect-guarantee/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carrier Connect Guarantee</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ensures connectivity to 90% of a customer’s full-truckload carrier network within 30 days of project kickoff, helping organizations lower operating costs, improve on-time performance and create better customer relationships. And its industry-first </span><a href=\"https://www.fourkites.com/press/fourkites-announces-industry-first-tracking-quality-guarantee/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tracking Quality Guarantee</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> establishes the highest standards in supply chain data, guaranteeing real-time visibility and predictive intelligence into a minimum of 90% of customer shipments, end-to-end and across every mode. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And on top of these awesome commitments to service, as a tech founder and CEO in the maritime space myself, I’m particularly interested in FourKites’ innovations in ocean visibility. From the Suez canal incident to the global container shortage and huge backlogs in ports, I’ve been paying close attention to the increased challenges the industry has been facing. And to me, it’s clear that visibility plays a huge part in overcoming these hurdles and preventing them from happening time after time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FourKites’ completeness of vision is evident once again in its next-generation ocean solution – </span><a href=\"https://www.fourkites.com/platform/ocean-freight-visibility/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dynamic Ocean</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  – that has the potential to transform a business’s entire international shipping operation, with end-to-end precision tracking, predictive ETAs and workflow, document management and collaboration all in one place. I think we can all agree that’s a game-changer. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/collaboration-meets-visibility-why-fourkites-recent-funding-success-brings-supply-chain-one-step-closer-to-the-future/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last month</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I talked about how FourKites integrates its passion for collaboration with its commitment to visibility, and this latest accolade, alongside its new customer guarantees, sees FourKites once again raising the bar in supply chain visibility. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Gartner report published 14 April 2021. </span></p>\n",

    "web_content": "<p>Is traditional physical retailing irretrievably broken? Many people think so— pointing to shuttered shops, town centers bereft of shoppers, and deserted malls.</p>\n<p>The Covid-19 pandemic, they argue, merely accelerated a trend that was already underway, stretching back 20 years: the rise of e-commerce, exemplified by e-tailers such as Amazon, Zalando, AO World, Boohoo, Zappos, and Asos.</p>\n<p>Traditional retail is certainly challenged. There’s no mistaking that. Across Europe and North America, once-successful store chains have simply lost relevance for today’s consumers, and imploded.</p>\n<p>Granted, in some cases, the individual retail brands live on, but only as online websites, bought out of bankruptcy by cannier operators—in the UK, for instance, e-tailers Boohoo and Asos acquired the clutch of fashion brands that were part of billionaire Philip Green’s Arcadia Group.</p>\n<h2>Low costs, and wide assortment</h2>\n<p>But to attribute all this to the inevitable and unstoppable rise of e-commerce is I think mistaken.</p>\n<p>Sure, e-commerce meets a need. For consumers who are acutely cost-conscious, e-commerce’s lower cost-to-serve and disintermediation efficiencies—no expensive city centre rents to pay, for instance—e-commerce will always appeal.</p>\n<p>E-commerce also works well with the ‘long tail’—the back catalogue and rich assortment that physical stores simply cannot stock, for lack of space.</p>\n<p>Amazon’s vast cavernous warehouses can hold far more books—and far more of anything else, for that matter—than any town centre shop ever could. Online fashion retailer Zalando presently stocks an almost-incredible 3,000 brands across its European operations and has announced an intention to increase that to 6,000 brands.</p>\n<h2>But consumers want more…</h2>\n<p>But maybe this is confusing cause and effect. Talk to retail experts—as I have, when writing my latest paper for Skill Dynamics, as the former Supply Chain Academy is called these days—and there’s something else going on.</p>\n<p>To be sure, e-commerce offers low pricing for easy-to-compare items. But today’s consumers, say these experts, want more than just low prices.</p>\n<p>They are becoming more individual in their aspirations, viewing what they buy as a way to differentiate themselves from others—hence the importance, and attraction, of the ‘long tail’, of course. The bigger the assortment, the greater the choice, and the more that they can differentiate themselves from their friends and neighbours.</p>\n<p>Consumers also want more from retailers than just stuff to buy. Generation Z consumers in particular want entertainment, social interaction, convenience, and service—there’s even a name for it: experiential commerce.</p>\n<p>And however convenient we all find Amazon, Zalando, and all the other top e-commerce sites that we all visit, it’s hardly experiential commerce.</p>\n<p>Nor is e-commerce a sinecure, whatever its appeal. Margins are tight, costs are rising, competition increasing, and brand loyalty low. Setting up a new e-commerce brand consumes significant amounts of investment, and it is all too easy to run out of cash before becoming profitable. For every successful e-tailer, plenty more fall by the wayside.</p>\n<h2>Play to your strengths</h2>\n<p>All of which, to my mind, signposts a way to the future. Traditional physical retailing is not going to wither away and die; e-commerce will not reign supreme.</p>\n<p>Instead, both will evolve. Physical retailing needs to do much more to differentiate itself from e-commerce, emphasising service and convenience and experiential commerce, and exploiting what advantages the model has—chiefly that physical retailers ‘touch’ their customers, arguably know them better, and can influence them more. At least, provided that they go about leveraging that greater customer intimacy intelligently.</p>\n<p>Which isn’t to say that they know them well enough yet, of course. Even today, Tesco’s Clubcard stands out as a shining example of how to acquire competition-beating customer data. Again and again, the experts with whom I discussed the challenges facing physical retailing stressed the importance of data, and data analytics. With data, you can not only outsell the competition—but also out-analyse the competition.</p>\n<p>E-commerce retailers have a different agenda. A better—and cheaper— returns process is a priority. Omnichannel for better service, where possible—perhaps in partnership with physical retailers, for whom an omnichannel partnership can drive footfall. A true ‘final mile’ capability. Own-label brands, to try and make fickle customers more ‘sticky’. And, once more, the experts with whom I spoke stressed the vital role played by data and data analytics.</p>\n<h2>Explore in depth</h2>\n<p>As I say, all this and more is discussed in my latest paper for Skill Dynamics, entitled The Future of Retail. And as well as outlining competitive strategies for retailers—both physical retailers and e-commerce retailers—there’s a wealth of material on the skills that retailers’ supply chain functions will need to hone as they shape those competitive responses.

Those types of traditional commercial deals exist, sure, but they’re only a small portion of the real, everyday impact of influencer marketing. Think about supply chain: are you more likely to check out a product if it’s been recommended by an industry expert like Sarah Barnes-Humphrey?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the recent State of B2B Influencer Marketing Research Report, 63% of marketers agree that their marketing would have better results if it included a B2B influencer marketing program. The question then becomes: how do I develop this sort of program and make it work for my business? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are five steps to setting up a successful influencer marketing strategy, and I’ll be detailing all of them for you below. These steps will work for any industry, but we’ll be paying special attention to their impact on the supply chain industry in this post. I’ve affectionately labeled this strategy the SMASH strategy thanks to its ability to smash through stagnancy and help businesses push forward.</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Set-up</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><b>First is set-up. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The foundation of any successful marketing strategy is information. This portion of the process is about gathering that information and organizing it in a way that is understandable and actionable. What questions do you need to answer about your business before you can move forward to the next step? Let’s review:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who is my target audience?</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are my main pain points?</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are my current solutions for those pain points?</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which topics are most relevant to my unique industry?</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who are my main competitors?</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are my business goals?</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which key performance indicators (KPIs) are most important to my business?</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which social media channels are we currently using?</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The answers to these questions will give you a solid foundation to build your influencer marketing strategy around. It’s far easier to get where you want to go if you know exactly where you are when you start your journey. It decreases your likelihood of getting lost along the way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This set-up data is going to help you determine two of the most important parts of this SMASHing process: the supply chain influencers that are most in line with your business&#8217; niche and the creative direction you take to reach out to them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">#2. Manage</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next step is to </span><b>manage the information</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you gained through the set-up part of the process. Now that you have your foundational business data, what&#8217;s next? What’s next is making sure you can use that data to your benefit. You’ve determined where you’ve been, and now you need to know where you’re going next.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the set-up portion of the SMASH process was gathering seeds, the manage portion is about planting them. Before you plant anything, you have to make sure the soil is fertile. Is </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">your</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> soil fertile? You can figure that out by asking yourself these questions:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Are there any social media channels you’re not on that you should be using? </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If so, it’s time to set up accounts. If you’re going to want to develop a successful influencer marketing strategy, you’re going to need the social presence required to reach out and build those key relationships.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>What resources do you have at your disposal?</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In the introduction, I mentioned the two kinds of influencers are earned and paid ones. An earned influencer is one that promotes your product just because they like it. These require a lot of effort and nurturing, but come at less up front cost. Earned influencers can be volatile because you have no control over the narrative, but they&#8217;re still a possibility for any business that doesn&#8217;t have as much up front monetary budget. Otherwise, you have paid influencers, which are individuals you have offered compensation to in order to promote your product or service. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>What are your volume requirements?</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you’re interested in developing a SMASHing influencer marketing strategy, you’ll want to figure out how many influencers you’re interested in working with before moving forward. If you set a number too high, it’s easy to get overwhelmed, so start with a smaller, scalable number that can work and grow with you.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you have these answers, it&#8217;ll become easier to create a plan for reaching out to and nurturing your influencers of choice. You have your analytical data and you&#8217;ve set up your social accounts and expectations, so the next step of your influencer marketing plan will be outreach. I&#8217;ve labeled this as the </span><b>answer</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> portion of the SMASH process because it answers the question of, &#8220;What do I need to do now to capture the interest of an influencer I want to work with?&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">#3. Answer</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here&#8217;s the part of the SMASH process that starts talking more directly about reaching out to influencers. There&#8217;s no influencer marketing without influencers, after all, and now we want to </span><a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2021/04/hire-b2b-influencer-marketing-agency/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><b>answer questions</b></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and develop a plan that accomplishes just that. The effort you&#8217;ve made in the last two steps should leave you feeling more than prepared for this part. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To continue our gardening metaphor, if </span><b>set-up</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was gathering seeds and </span><b>manage</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was planting them, this portion of the process is laying down the fertilizer to make sure those seeds grow.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’re going to start reaching out now, but before you do there are a couple more things to take care of first:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Do you have analytics set-up for the social media channels you&#8217;re currently using?</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If not, you&#8217;ll want that to be set up now so that the data can be utilized in the final step of this process. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>What are your brand standards and are they documented?</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Influencer outreach is going to involve developing a successful online brand presence, and that will include having a modern and well developed look, tone, and general feel.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the step where you can start brainstorming and developing fun, creative content. Things like: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A content plan for your website’s blog and social channels that focuses on the topics covered in set-up </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A plan for influencer outreach and a vetted list of the first influencers you want to reach out to</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steps you can take to capture influencer vision and make yourself a brand that your preferred influencers are going to want to work with</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The development of these types of detailed plans is almost always best left to a professional B2B marketing company. That doesn’t mean you can’t start on your own to gather ideas that fit with your already determined priorities and goals. </span></p>\n<p><b>One more important tip:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> when you’re looking for a B2B marketing company to partner with to develop strategies like those listed in this part of the SMASH process, look for ones that self-label as </span><a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2021/04/hire-b2b-influencer-marketing-agency/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">influencer marketing experts</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If they prioritize influencer marketing enough to make it a part of their main service offering, they’ll have the sort of specialized expertise you’re going to want. </span></p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Share</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you&#8217;re at the </span><b>share</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> portion of the SMASH process, stop to give yourself a pat on the back. You&#8217;ve already gone a long way toward significantly differentiating your supply chain business and should feel proud. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of all the steps, this one is the most active. Unlike some of the others, the sharing portion will go on indefinitely because you&#8217;ll always be creating new content in need of promotion. During this part, you’re going to be focusing on getting the content you’ve started to create in front of the influencers you want to impress. You’ll be using the social media profiles that have been set up and gathering data about what’s working and what isn’t for analysis in the final part of the process. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember our gardening metaphor? Set-up is gathering seeds, manage is planting them, answer is fertilization, and share is making sure everything that has begun to sprout is properly watered.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s important to note that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to working with B2B influencers, especially in the supply chain industry. There will be unique factors to consider for each unique influencer company. That being said, here are a couple good rules of thumb to consider when attempting to engage influencers: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Make them aware of you before you ask them for anything.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> You want to give influencers a chance to be familiar with your brand before you reach out. This will make developing your partnership easier, because they&#8217;ll already have passive trust in your brand. This is also why it&#8217;s so important to have a </span><a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2017/09/seo-research-tools-content/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">content plan</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> before this point so that you’ve already laid the groundwork for better connections later on. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Know what your goal is before reaching out. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Influencers are busy people and aren&#8217;t going to want their time wasted. Don&#8217;t send out pitches or other contacts willy nilly. Instead, make sure you know your goal before initiating any sort of contact because that goal will influence the way you reach out. What do you want from this influencer? Are you interested in them sharing your content or attending an event? Providing a testimonial or creating a multi-part video series extolling the virtues of your product? Always plan before you preach.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’re always going to partially be in the share stage as you work on your influencer marketing strategy. This is the part of the plan which focuses on connection and outreach, which is the cornerstone of influencer connections. The information you get from what works </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">what doesn’t work in this stage will help you in the next, final, one.</span></p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Hypothesize</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You&#8217;ve done most of the work and now you get to </span><b>hypothesize</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about what comes next. This step is influenced by all the information and experience that has been gained from the four previous. You’ve planted and tended your garden and now you can see which crops are thriving and which need more help before a successful harvest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember when I told you it was important to set up analytics for all of your company social profiles? When you get to the </span><b>hypothesize</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> portion of the SMASH process, it&#8217;s time to look at that data and see what insight can be gleaned from it. Based on those insights, you can make tweaks and updates to your existing influencer marketing strategy to improve it&#8217;s overall success rate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ask yourself: would I be more likely to invest in a product or service when it’s been recommended by someone I trust or admire? If your answer was yes, you’re not alone. That’s why influencer marketing has become a larger and more significant part of modern B2B marketing over time, and why the SMASH process was developed in the first place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re interested in learning more about influencer marketing, you can find more information by </span><a href=\"https://www.toprankmarketing.com/influencer-marketing-supply-chain/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">clicking here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and tuning into my appearance on the Let’s Talk Supply Chain podcast.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To everyone in the supply chain industry and beyond: I hope this process helps you find the same success it’s helped dozens of businesses before you achieve.

    "web_content": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everybody knows that there are two things I absolutely love: collaboration, and visibility. And never have these two things been more important than this past year. We’ve faced unprecedented times, as the COVID-19 pandemic tore through the industry, disrupting everything from manufacturing to shipping; whilst simultaneously demanding supply chain step up, as the safe movement of things like food, vaccines and essential household supplies became paramount. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve talked to so many businesses about the weaknesses the pandemic has exposed within our industry; the stress points its tested; the outdated methodologies and technologies it’s unveiled. But I’ve also talked a lot about the positives – the benefits that have come from shining a light on those hidden, or forgotten, weaknesses; the amazing agility and resilience we discovered (that we didn’t even know we had!); the new, more innovative mindsets that have emerged. And a renewed and enthusiastic commitment to collaboration and visibility are undeniably two of the most important outcomes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One company who’s really doubled down on their commitment to these two vital areas is </span><a href=\"https://www.fourkites.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FourKites</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Despite the struggles that much of the industry is still facing FourKites, a leading global supply chain software brand focused on bringing real-time visibility to supply chain, has incredibly just secured $100 million of Series D growth financing. This hugely important deal will help them to continue their mission of taking visibility end to end, connecting the physical and digital worlds of warehouses, stores and transportation with real-time data and machine learning to </span><a href=\"https://www.fourkites.com/future-of-digital-supply-chains/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">transform supply chains</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on an epic scale. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The investment comes courtesy of huge names THL, Volvo Group, Zebra Technologies, Qualcomm, August Capital, CEAS Investments, Hyde Park Angels, Hyde Park Venture Partners and Bain Capital – clearly demonstrating that FourKites isn&#8217;t the only big industry name committed to transforming global supply chain with end-to-end visibility, utilizing the power of collaboration. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because these investors don’t just bring capital to the table; they aren’t just boastful, big business name drops. These partnerships are the definition of strategic alliance, where brand visions for customer satisfaction, technology, efficiency and everything in between truly align to create the most robust, innovative strategies to drive the industry forward. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whilst THL shares a commitment to supply chain automation, Volvo Group Venture Capital focuses on trends that are shaping the future of transportation. Zebra Technologies brings leadership in enterprise asset intelligence and Qualcomm Ventures shares its scale and capabilities in wireless, 5G and IoT technologies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This supply chain supergroup brings fresh ideas, expertise, innovation and capabilities to the pioneering FourKites platform that will not only help to propel FourKites into the future, but will change the trajectory of the industry forever and set the tone for supply chain for years to come. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FourKites has an amazing vision for the future, a vision that I share as well. A vision of interconnected, secure, intelligent networks where supply chain partners can find new ways to optimize operations, innovate and deliver greater customer service and value through real-time visibility.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And this new financing deal, combining capital with collaboration to deliver ultimate visibility, brings us all one step closer to that vision. </span></p>\n",

    "web_content": "<p>The strangest and most complicated year of this century is over, we are now in 2021, called the year of hope &#8230;. in the form of vaccines and cure for this damn virus that has infected more than 80MM of people, and killed already almost 2MM globally. We will all wish to return to the world we lived in before Covid19 arrival.</p>\n<p>From 2020 to 2021 in theory only 1 digit changes, but this single number feeds millions of dreams and wishes made by all citizens of our planet, after several hard months of restrictions, suffering limitations on what was once our &#8220;normal&#8221; life.</p>\n<p>We have been many months without traveling, going out to restaurants, enjoying with our friends, hug each other naturally and now we even need to wear a protective mask to walk in the street in several countries. Many governments have restricted our temporal or geographical freedom of movement.</p>\n<p>If we think about it for a moment, we will see that we´ve made all these great sacrifices to stop the virus, because no one wants to sacrifice their individual rights at any time and wants to continue to maintain them, whatever the existing external threat.</p>\n<p>Now it is a question of gaining the right to end this long period of restrictions, reducing the virus capacity to infect others, probably assuming some permanent changes in our global life dynamics. These new rules are yet to be determined, because no one knows for sure which of the transformations experienced will end up being permanent for all.</p>\n<p>One initial recommended new routine action that we can do is to extreme the quality of our food, ensuring our immune system is as well prepared as possible to defend itself with more guarantee from the virus infection.</p>\n<p>I would now like to share the summary of my learnings from 2020 just finished, and provide some tips for 2021, which I will implement in order to improve my existence and that of those around me, as far as possible.</p>\n<h2>My five main learnings for 2020 have been:</h2>\n<p>* We all need freedom: When we lack it, we value it much more. We must never lose it, and, in any case, have the inner strength to find it at all times, despite any external physical constraints. At least, we always have the freedom of our minds!</p>\n<p>* Personal development requires that we know ourselves, especially how to recognize and manage our own emotions. If you can notice them in advance, much better!</p>\n<p>* Global changes and transformations are not (only) linked to technology, but depend on our ability to understand and manage them satisfactorily.</p>\n<p>* Open transparent communications are key for people to understand each other</p>\n<p>* The &#8220;Supply Chain&#8221; (as an integration of all operations &amp; logistics process functions) has been consolidated as a critical area of ​​business, in all sectors of activity.</p>\n<h2>As for my tips for this 2021, with more personal and professional growth, they are:</h2>\n<p>1.- Open your mind, like an umbrella, and allow yourself CHANGES AND TRANSFORMATIONS: Train your curiosity, be creative and innovative and avoid saying &#8220;NO&#8221; as first answer to any change proposal.</p>\n<p>2.- Allow yourself personal development moments on a regular basis: Some people may think they do not need help, but an accompaniment to overcome our most difficult challenges is always a lever to get out more easily and perform better in less time.</p>\n<p>3.- Communicate, collaborate and coordinate with everyone else: We can be alone in many moments, but to advance in personal and/or professional projects it will always be necessary to do so by interacting with several people. Knowing how to do it right will be key to success.</p>\n<p>4.- Use professional networking as a lever to develop: No one ever has all the answers, but there are people who are so well connected that they always know who to ask their unsolved questions.</p>\n<p>5.- Talent development must always have time allocated in your agenda, either for yourself and for your teams.</p>\n<p>Finally, I wish you all a year full of happiness, personal and professional successes and improvements, in a world full of health and economic recovery for all humans.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take care of ourselves &amp; continue transforming.</p>\n<h3><strong>About The Author:</strong></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/miquelserracanta/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Miquel Serracanta</a> is a business advisor, focused on Supply Chain, by serving the global supply chain community in optimizing End-to-End Supply Chains.

    "web_content": "<p>It is not a secret that technology evolves at an accelerated rate.  As an example, I have seen the progress of vinyl records to cassettes to compact discs to playable digital files and finally to streaming media.  My teenage sons, on the other hand, have never owned a CD and barely recall downloading mp3s.</p>\n<p>One of the more interesting advances in technology, particularly in a business and consumer setting is in the area of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).  Building upon the confluence of device (sensor) proliferation, high speed data ingestion and advances in computing power, AI/ML produces use case-driven insights that we leverage in what seems like all aspects of our lives.</p>\n<p>It is an advancing space that is both obvious &#8211; think of the personal assistant on the smart phone of your choice &#8211; and yet subtle – think of the fitness device insights and streaming service viewing suggestions &#8211; at the same time.</p>\n<p>In the world of logistics, the contributing forces are similar.  The availability of disparate data and highly scalable ingestion engines, the advent of performant and elastic public clouds, and the wider adoption of open application program interfaces (APIs), presents a ripe opportunity to apply AI/ML to provide unique, incremental value.</p>\n<p>But like many things, how do you separate hype from reality?  In our consumer world, if our streaming service suggests something that we wouldn’t watch, we just skip over it.  If my fitness watch tells me to rest when my coach tells me to train, then I train.  In the world of supply chain, however, poor or weak insights have real impact and real cost.</p>\n<p>To separate the wheat from the chaff, I suggest considering three approaches:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Avoid the general:</strong> Many solutions will boast being “AI/ML powered” as if it is just something you turn on and it magically makes things better but that is not how it works. Learning models are designed to focus on specific cases.  Labor and order forecasting, and transportation risk assessments are good examples of particular use cases.</li>\n<li><strong>The right data in abundance:</strong> AI/ML models require data and lots of it. The good news is that in today’s age, data is abundant.  The more difficult question is understanding what data the model is trained to ingest and leverage and how reliable are those data sources.  A model to evaluate execution risk on planned loads will be limited if the scope and availability of constraint and network data are overly simple or unreliable.</li>\n<li><strong>Proven in reality: </strong>It is easy to come up with a premise of value, but a premise is immaterial unless it is tested with real data ingestion and measured against a control. Only by creating real world circumstances can a premise be proven and more importantly measured.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Applying this in practice, let’s take an example of a logistics solution promising AI/ML powered routing.  Working through the steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Avoid the general:</strong> What aspect of route planning is being improved? e.g. load fill rate, driver assignment, route sequence.</li>\n<li><strong>The right data in abundance:</strong> What data is the model leveraging? What is the timeliness and reliability of that data? What is the scope of the data being considered?</li>\n<li><strong>Proven in reality: </strong>Has the problem been solved in a real-world scenario? In what circumstances e.g. a grocery environment will have different data and considerations than an industrial manufacturer.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The acceleration of technology is enough to give anyone pause.  The opportunity these advancements present are unprecedented but also forces us to really understand what data is there.  By interrogating three simple perspectives, we can quickly separate the real from the noise and take our logistics networks from vinyl to streaming.</p>\n<h2>About the Author</h2>\n<p><strong>Fabrizio Brasca, Group Vice President, Global Solutions, Blue Yonder</strong></p>\n<p><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-4379\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Fab-Brasca-Headshot-2020-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Fab-Brasca-Headshot-2020-200x300.jpg 200w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Fab-Brasca-Headshot-2020-600x900.jpg 600w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Fab-Brasca-Headshot-2020-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Fab-Brasca-Headshot-2020-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Fab-Brasca-Headshot-2020.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" />Fabrizio (Fab) Brasca is group vice president (GVP), global solutions at Blue Yonder.  In this role, he leads his organization to drive thought leadership, go-to-market strategy and solution execution excellence for Blue Yonder’s 4,000+ customer base.  Additionally, his organization works closely with customers to understand requirements, drive best practices and adoption of Blue Yonder solutions across the globe.</p>\n<p>Previously, he was VP of solution strategy, supply chain execution, responsible for developing innovative strategies across all industry verticals, strengthening executive-level relationships with JDA’s key customers and prospects and advising companies on best practices to become more profitable.

    "web_content": "<p>With volume spikes, prolonged truck price increases, and record-level tender rejections, 2020 has been one of the most volatile years in recent freight market history. If you’re like most shippers we’ve talked to, you’ve had to work hard this year to get the coverage you need, and have brought on new capacity providers to fill the gap. Are you taking into consideration all of the quality and compliance risks of your providers?</p>\n<p>The drivers who move your product present legal, financial, service and reputational risks for your business. Read on to learn why quality and compliance is something you should be talking about with your brokers and carriers, what questions you should be asking, and how Machine Learning is being used to change the game when it comes to driver quality and compliance.</p>\n<h2>The risks of quality and compliance in freight</h2>\n<p>At a high level, shippers face legal, financial, service and reputation risks every time they ship freight.</p>\n<p><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4363 size-full\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/convoy-.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"977\" height=\"454\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/convoy-.png 977w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/convoy--600x279.png 600w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/convoy--300x139.png 300w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/convoy--768x357.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 977px) 100vw, 977px\" /></p>\n<p><b>Legal risks &#8211;</b> On the legal side, there has been a trend over the past 10-15 years where shippers can be held liable for the actions of their carriers via vicarious liability. Similarly, a precedent has been set around negligent hiring. Here, if the carrier hauling the load is deemed unfit (due to authority, insurance, safety history, or some other reason) legal ramifications can come down on the shipper.</p>\n<p><b>Financial risks &#8211; </b>Not only are there the legal costs if you are pulled into a lawsuit but also compensatory costs if you are held liable, as well as increased insurance costs. Plus, poor-quality drivers lead to a higher number of cargo claims which can have a material impact on transportation costs.</p>\n<p><b>Service and reputation risks &#8211; </b>Service and reputation often go hand in hand. Poor service such as late pickups and deliveries, accidents, and cargo damage can have negative implications for the service you give to your customers and your ability to continue to earn their business</p>\n<h2>The pitfalls of using CSA ratings for quality and compliance</h2>\n<p>Many traditional brokers and asset carriers who broker loads use the FMCSA’s CSA ratings to determine whether or not a driver is good to haul. This approach has a lot of blind-spots because the CSA rating program was not meant to be used as a mechanism to understand carrier safety and compliance. In fact, it was designed solely for enforcement authorities to intervene with very poor performing carriers.</p>\n<p>Based on time and resources, the FMCSA only does a full inspection of carriers who have been flagged by their system. Typically, only carriers with a significant amount of safety violations qualify for a full review which means that a startling 95% of carriers are not rated at all.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4364 size-full\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/convoy-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"977\" height=\"495\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/convoy-2.png 977w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/convoy-2-600x304.png 600w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/convoy-2-300x152.png 300w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/convoy-2-768x389.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 977px) 100vw, 977px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When capacity providers rely on CSA ratings to vet their drivers they have very limited visibility into the vast majority of safety records. This prevents an adequate assessment of carrier and driver safety during hiring and leads to a lot of uncertainty for shippers.</p>\n<h2>Five questions you should be asking to improve quality and reduce risk</h2>\n<p>Not sure where to start? Use these five questions to check-in with your brokers and carriers to make sure you’re on the same page.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Are you registered, licensed and bonded? </strong>This may seem basic, and it is. But if you or your team is frantically trying to find coverage for backup or spot, this fundamental step can be overlooked, and introduce significant risk.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>What types of insurance do you have, and what do you require of your carriers?  </strong>A freight partner with a comprehensive and thoughtfully designed suite of insurance policies will be a better partner in managing risk. sleep easier at night by verifying that your freight partner has  the following core types of coverage or suitable equivalents: Broker liability, excess liability, contingent and additional transportation cargo coverage, workers compensation and employer liability, crime, and mandatory broker bond insurance.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>How is carrier and driver safety assessed?  </strong>Accidents are an unfortunate reality in this industry, so you need to take proactive steps to mitigate risk by requiring transportation partners to set safety standards that are acceptable for your business. Ask for a list of what their safety standards are. You should be provided with a speedy and thorough reply that amounts to more than “We don’t use unsatisfactory rated carriers.”</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>How often are carriers screened and audited after onboarding?  </strong>It’s not enough to check for compliance requirements at the time of onboarding. Even regularly scheduled static checks (e.g. once a quarter or, gasp, once a year) of carriers is insufficient. We recommend working with partners who can audit their carriers automatically and in real time — at least daily if not more frequently.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>How do you identify and address fraud?  </strong>In this industry, data is a powerful tool that everyone should use to prevent fraud. Your transportation providers should have a clear process to identify fraudulent sign-ups onto their platform.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>How Machine Learning is changing the quality and compliance landscape</h2>\n<p>At Convoy, in order to safely and accurately vet our carrier network we created a robust <a href=\"https://convoy.com/shippers/quality-safety-compliance/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">quality and compliance program</a> from the ground-up. This industry-leading program leverages a rich data set and vet carriers not just once, but every single time they are assigned to a load. This is where Machine Learning comes in.</p>\n<p>There are thousands of data inputs, like speeding violations and inspection outcomes, that can be vetted across millions of carrier records, which means information is changing all the time. Not only is identifying the safest carriers a challenge, but being able to constantly monitor compliance as it fluctuates in real-time is a feat no human can accomplish. Convoy uses Machine Learning to process millions of inputs in a short time, correlate them to crash likelihood, and generate a score for every carrier that indicates how safe that carrier actually is.</p>\n<p>The more data we feed our model, the more accurate it becomes, and because it’s a learning algorithm, it actually gets better over time, driving incremental accuracy and better results. This approach has resulted in a carrier network with 16% fewer accidents compared to the rest of the industry, as well as a claims-incident ratio that is 20x lower than the industry average. With Machine Learning, Convoy has taken the guesswork out of carrier safety assessment, and replaced it with concrete, data-based modeling to yield bottom-line results for our shippers.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4365 size-full\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/convoy-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"977\" height=\"487\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/convoy-3.png 977w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/convoy-3-600x299.png 600w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/convoy-3-300x150.png 300w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/convoy-3-768x383.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 977px) 100vw, 977px\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://convoy.com/bookatruck\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Sign up</em></a><em> for Convoy’s free shipper platform today and start taking advantage of the benefits of Convoy’s industry-leading quality and compliance approach.

The development of COVID-19 vaccines are imminent and seen as a solution that the world is looking for to see a return to some semblance of normal. When vaccines are available, getting the vaccine from production to the global population will be the next challenge.</p>\n<p>Vaccine development is the first step in an extensive distribution process. Governments need to plan and build the strategies, infrastructure, and organization to manage the post-production supply chain for vaccine delivery. There will be significant differences between the global north and the global south in how governments can address these challenges.</p>\n<p>A vaccine delivery ecosystem is required to coordinate this supply chain challenge. This VDE is a public-private partnership (PPP) that orchestrates the private and public networks to ensure that populations are effectively inoculated. This blueprint provides an overview that includes problem definition, direction, and opportunities for technology use cases in addressing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The global distribution process’s scale and complexity, requiring processes, checks, and balances that provide supply chain control.</li>\n<li>The integrity and security of the vaccine, along with the protection of the information that goes with it. This protection level needs to occur through storage, delivery, and transport of the cargo as it travels within and between countries.</li>\n<li>Customs and international border crossing procedures, which need to be reviewed to prevent disruptions and delays, destroying the vaccine through poor temperature control, mishandling or incorrect documentation.</li>\n<li>End-to-end monitoring of temperature, ensuring the integrity of documents and data to meet compliance requirements, and last-mile distribution all need to be assured to reduce waste and slow the pace of the virus.</li>\n<li>The integration with healthcare systems to meet further compliance requirements and coordinate with any ad-hoc or interim facilities or procedures that may be required.</li>\n<li>The complexity of workforce, patient, PPE, and inventory scheduling.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This blueprint developed by the Logistics &amp; Supply Chain Management Society (LSCMS) in collaboration with <a href=\"https://www.idc.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">IDC</a>, serves as an awareness tool to drive open engagement between stakeholders to discuss safe and effective options for ensuring vaccination distribution with minimal waste and maximum integrity to the world’s population.</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://logisym.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LSCMS-IDC-Conquering-COVID19-supply-chain-vaccine-v1-final.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Download the full report here.</strong></a></h2>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2><strong>About LogiSYM</strong></h2>\n<p>LogiSYM is the collaborative platform of The Logistics &amp; Supply Chain Management Society and engages the industry through its collaborative platforms, LogiSYM and CargoNOW.</p>\n<p>Practically all areas of the Logistics spectrum are represented and connected.

    "web_content": "<p>One of the most important people in your company may not even be in the room when you make big procurement decisions. If you choose a supplier and don’t have a supply chain manager in the conversation, you run the risk of taking on a contract that will leave you wanting.</p>\n<p>Too often, supply chains are afterthoughts, and initial costs are the focus of procurement. However, the “per piece price” mindset covers only a fraction of the total cost of ownership (TCO) over the full life of an item. Remaining aware of TCO can help organizations make every budgeted dollar go further.</p>\n<h2>The benefits are often ongoing</h2>\n<p>Simply stated, the TCO approach asks you to consider your entire business and not just single costs. Then the equation can shift from saving money on a part or tool’s initial cost to developing cost savings that can be realized on a reoccurring basis.</p>\n<p>With a mix of hard and soft cost savings, TCO’s benefits come in the form of freed-up time and additional production from existing resources.</p>\n<p>TCO solutions are aimed at chipping away at the total cost of ownership. The goal is to find a way to do more with less: to manage inventory more effectively, to streamline processes, and to eliminate waste.</p>\n<p>This is particularly important when it comes to MRO, where piece price can typically represent less than 50% of the total costs associated with low-dollar, high-use supplies. (Think of safety goggles or earplugs.) And while commodity pricing is a key element, an even greater savings opportunity can often be found in the many indirect costs associated with acquiring, owning, and managing inventory. Some strategic TCO partners in the market today will assume that work and those costs – thus alleviating you and freeing up savings that can be reinvested in growth-driving areas of the business.</p>\n<h2>AREAS TO CONSIDER</h2>\n<p>Nothing has a single cost. Think of these factors to help develop a TCO mindset.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Purchase Price:</strong> The price paid</li>\n<li><strong>Acquisition Cost:</strong> Time spent to research, order, receive, inventory, and disperse an item.</li>\n<li><strong>Freight:</strong> Shipping and handling</li>\n<li><strong>Operation:</strong> The cost of using an item, i.e. fuel or electricity</li>\n<li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Any costs associated with maintaining, repairing, and servicing</li>\n<li><strong>Lifespan:</strong> How long an item will last before it needs replacing</li>\n<li><strong>Additional Costs:</strong> Financing, any disposal fees, and insurance or warranty</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Every Step Should Add Value</h2>\n<p>If there are steps in your workflows that do not add value to your end-user, how can you reduce or eliminate those steps? Quality Assurance adds value because it ensures defects aren’t reaching customers. How does stocking parts add value? Often, it doesn’t.</p>\n<p>Finding a third party to handle that work means your employees have more time to do what they do best: create your product, serve your customers, and grow your business.</p>\n<p>Partnering with an expert can go a long way toward reaping TCO benefits. They can help you standardize what’s included in your TCO planning, set how results are measured, and regularly review how things are going. <em>A truly strategic partner will share usage data with you to provide visibility so you can adapt and grow your business. </em></p>\n<h2>The Big Takeaway</h2>\n<p>There’s more to a purchase than the initial payment, and a TCO attitude can keep benefiting the bottom line. Even if a supply chain manager isn’t in the room with you for some conversations, that TCO mindset can be.</p>\n<p><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4138\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Picture1-300x188.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"188\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Picture1-300x188.png 300w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Picture1.png 380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /> <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4139\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Picture2-300x233.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"233\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Picture2-300x233.png 300w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Picture2.png 341w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>About The Author:</strong></h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4148 size-thumbnail alignleft\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Nathan-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Nathan-150x150.jpg 150w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Nathan-300x300.jpg 300w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Nathan-100x100.jpg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" />Besides TCO, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathan-hassler-4ab41b194/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Nathan Hassler</a> also helps customers with supply chain solutions like Lean manufacturing, point-of-use inventory, and strategic partnerships. And as part of the team at Fastenal, Nathan is always working to help procurement professionals find new ways to become more productive.</p>\n",

    "web_content": "<p>The most common consumer behavior during sales periods is bargain article search, especially articles with high value but significantly lower price than regular. This happen in all markets, including stock exchange. But there are always other people willing to get rid of some assets, believing in the opposite criteria: stocks are worth less than current market prices, so they want to recover their money sooner, before losing more in that downward trend. So, the real value of an article, product or stock is a subjective criteria, based on individual needs, analysis &amp; interpretation of future market evolution.</p>\n<p>The issue here appears when an item that was bought for a very low price -cheaper than others- performs poorly in quality and/or requirements compared with what was expected initially by its buyer. This issue will make him/her buy a new substitute item, generating a higher total cost of the item compared with what they would have paid if they bought the more expensive one initially, with likely higher quality &amp; performance.</p>\n<p>I would now like to link this to talent management and professional career development, in which we are suffering an era of constant bargains and salary reductions. Taking advantage of the excess of professionals actively job searching in the face of a lower demand for candidates by companies, when they hire staff they are lowering the salary proposals they offer in order to save money. When the number of available professionals in the market exceeds the number of positions to fill there, like it has been happening in last 5/6 years in some developed countries (ie: Spain), salaries for equivalent positions are reduced by 20-30% at different organizational levels, a trend driven by the search for short-term financial savings.</p>\n<p>By this practice, each of the hiring companies enter a negative spiral towards less talent retainment and additional loss of talent, which try to move themselves to healthier business environments. This business negative circle continues when these low performing companies choose to hire less prepared candidates -then paying less money to them-, achieving short-term financial savings, but failing to capture enough talent to make their business high performing and thus sustainable over time.</p>\n<p>On the other side, companies that have not entered into such short-term dynamic of solely focusing on economic cost reductions, have been able to better retain their talent and attract new additional talent, which certainly gives them a medium/long term greater value, thanks to the contributions that this greater human capital will provide their businesses, for sure. In short, saving on talent is, in my opinion, a huge mistake, although in the short term it can mean immediate savings, in the medium term would lead the company to a much worse scenario than the original, with poorer business results. So, a professional who really has a value is worth it, and should be paid accordingly and fairly based on its contributions in the short, medium and long term, without rebates or salary reductions. Achieving savings by hiring at a price lower than the real market value can never be considered a good practice by a headhunter company or a hiring company. Warren Buffet once said: &#8220;Hire the best and let them do what they know, instead of hiring the cheapest to do what you tell them to&#8221;, obviously the results will be very different in both cases.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure that today hiring companies don&#8217;t select candidates who do not initially meet the required technical (&#8220;hard&#8221;) skills, and during the final personal interviews they evaluate &#8220;soft&#8221; skills such as for example: Communication skills, Learning abilities, Teamwork capabilities or adaptability to work under stress to decide who to finally contract. I would like to end with what I believe each of us can do to have more employability and opportunities to find a new job. So, let me share here my three final tips for efficient Supply Chain Talent Searching: 1. Find your own &#8220;differential value&#8221; as a candidate, knowing the real market value of the skills you can bring to a company2. Create, maintain and care for an excellent network of professional contacts, which will allow you to open doors that are probably closed for other competitor candidates3. Ensure to have proper training in essential technical skills for each position to which you&#8217;re applying. In any case advanced English knowledge and advanced spreadsheets management, are both essential for any Supply Chain professional. Finally, when having any doubt about which should be the first step, the best advice I can give you, is to ask for expert advice.</p>\n<h3><strong>About The Author:</strong></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/miquelserracanta/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Miquel Serracanta</a> is a business advisor, focused on Supply Chain, by serving the global supply chain community in optimizing End-to-End Supply Chains.

    "web_content": "<p><strong>At the release of the white paper on the benefits of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) released by The Logistics &amp; Supply Chain Management Society and Automation Anywhere on 27<sup>th</sup> August , it was highlighted that Small to medium-sized forwarders and logistics providers are failing to reap all the productivity benefits of robotic process automation (RPA), according to one of the world’s leading logistics experts.</strong></p>\n<p>Professor Richard Wilding OBE, of Cranfield University, in the UK, said that most small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) in the forwarding and logistics sector could free up resources and reduce costs by automating basic, repetitive processes.</p>\n<h2><strong>Repetitive processes are a waste</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0in 0in 7.5pt 0in;\"><span lang=\"EN-SG\" style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #333333;\">Companies should identify any processes that are repetitive in nature, document the process and look at how RPA can be applied to automate the task, he said in a response to a question raised by co-host and leading supply chain expert, Dr. Raymon Krishnan.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; vertical-align: baseline;\"><span lang=\"EN-SG\" style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #333333;\">“One of the key things in implementing [RPA] is to get everybody in the business to actually think about the types of processes they&#8217;re undertaking,” he told the press during a press briefing organised by LogiSYM.</span></p>\n<p style=\"vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0in 0in 7.5pt 0in;\"><span lang=\"EN-SG\" style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #333333;\">“If you’re an SME, have a workshop and identify all those repetitive rules-based processes that you’re undertaking because that can help identify particular things which are going on within your organization which you can start applying [robotic process automation] technologies to.”</span></p>\n<p style=\"vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0in 0in 7.5pt 0in;\"><span lang=\"EN-SG\" style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #333333;\">Wilding continued: “These repetitive processes are a waste.

    "web_content": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Supply chain business can be difficult to get into, and finding success can be much harder. Between the rise of globalization and constantly shifting customer demand, today’s supply chain operations are very different from the past. However, this doesn’t mean that we can’t rely on the experience of those that have come before us to get to where we want to go. In fact, the best supply chain practices are rooted in age-old principles. Below are some of them.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><b>Prepare and do your homework</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For new entries, the very first thing you should be doing is researching everything about what you’re getting into—from your chosen industry, to the general good practices. The former is especially important, as the flow of an industry’s supply chain is heavily affected by things like trends, costs, and, most importantly, customer expectation. For example, since the fashion industry has been one of the least sustainable industries in the global market, customers are expecting that supply chains will also </span><a href=\"https://www.digitalistmag.com/digital-supply-networks/2019/12/02/how-slow-fashion-is-fast-tracking-sustainability-06201743/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">do their part to contribute</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to a greener society.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for knowing the general good practices, well, there’s a lot to be learned from the </span><a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/vidya-netrakanti-talks-adapting-in-supply-chain-during-a-pandemic/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">words of an industry expert</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Vidya Netrakanti, chief operating officer and CEO of Optessa Inc., advises newcomers to keep business and personal finances separate. She even discusses the importance of investing in connections and your employees, especially during a crisis.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><b>Verify your designs and nip problems in the bud</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to manufacturing products, nothing is more important than quality. As such, before you ship them to your clients, you have to ensure that they’re all created perfectly. This is true across all industries, but more so for intricate products such as printed circuit boards (PCBs) and computer hardware. </span><a href=\"https://www.altium.com/solution/design-verification-in-altium-designer/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Verifying design verification datasheets</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with the designers allows you to sort out all the potential problems before you even encounter them. This makes the entire process smoother in the long run.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><b>Focus on your strengths, and use the right tools for the rest</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are plenty of aspects where a supply chain company can excel in. Your strengths can include your purchasing power, for one. This is especially useful for distributors in big industries like food and beverage, as they can afford to buy items in bulk—and perhaps get them at lower prices. Your strength could even lie in negotiation or lower freight costs. Whatever your best assets are, use them well. Then, for all other aspects, </span><a href=\"https://www.supplychainquarterly.com/articles/2122-logistics-outsourcing-to-increase-in-2020\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">outsource them to more capable hands</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This will improve not only the efficiency of your operations, but their quality as well.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><b>Be prepared to adapt</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As aforementioned, industries can be extremely unpredictable. The technology sector, for example, is one where customer demand is always linear and constant. This means that when one vendor falls short of your expectations, others will be there to pick up the slack. In this situation, what you need is an extremely flexible supply chain, one where multiple entities are capable of turning around items immediately. We have a word for this type of behavior: </span><a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/adaptability-is-the-key-to-creating-resilient-supply-chains/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">supply web adaptability</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This is the capacity of a company to manage, react, and subsequently change their operations with little to no negative impacts on time, cost, quality, or performance. Always keep in mind your company’s size, market, and goals; learn to pivot them as the economy demands.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The supply chain involves a lot of moving parts, so you always have a plan for every aspect of the operation. Be flexible and utilize your strengths.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Written by Brienne Jerrett</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">exclusively for letstalksupplychain.com</span></p>\n",

    "web_content": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/season-2-ep-2-adventures-in-big-data-w-chris-lee-logistical-labs/\">data</a> doesn’t have a COAT, there could be a range of bad or costly decisions made which could affect the business performance, financial situation, risk jobs, or even the fate of the company.  You wouldn&#8217;t go out in freezing temperatures without the appropriate coat and you shouldn’t work with data or make business decisions without the same level of protection – accurate data.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And, just like with coats, there are different levels of quality data services out there. If you buy a cheap jacket, it might not be waterproof or protect you from the elements, it won’t last much longer than one season and you’ll need to buy another the next time winter rolls around again. It’s the same with data &#8211; if you don’t invest in good quality service you will end up paying twice as much, if not more, in the long run to fix the earlier mistakes. Don’t be left out in the cold.</span></p>\n<p><b>So, what is COAT?</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><b>Consistent </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">– Generally data is used by many people or teams, which can lead to multiple classifications of one product. For example, one person might put DHL as a ‘courier’, while another might log it as ‘logistics’ or ‘warehousing’.  A taxi might be classified generically as ‘travel’ when it should be classed as ‘Travel &gt; Road Transport &gt; Taxis’ and a project cost should be assigned to the same budget or GL code, not several.  Or it could even be a simple as units of measurement. One person may use ‘Litre’, another ‘Ltr’ and another ‘L’ – but these should all be one format.  This means everything can be reported accurately, you get a true picture of what’s going on and better business decisions can be made. </span></p>\n<p><b>Organised</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> – Data is only useful if it’s organised.  Think of a messy closet, you’re looking for your favourite top but can&#8217;t find it as everything has been thrown in there.  And, much like your closest, you can organise your data in different ways, depending on what you want to get out of it and that will produce different reports/analytics.  You may want to assign data to employees, teams, departments, functions or internal categories, as well as time periods such as months and quarters, or year groups like P1, P2 etc… So, for example, when you need the information on the accounts that Sharon in Finance is working on, or the sales teams’ performance for the quarter &#8211; you can pull that information quickly.</span></p>\n<p><b>Accurate </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">– This can mean different things to different people. At its most basic level, accurate data is correct.  In more detail, this could be no duplicate information; correct invoice descriptions; correct classifications; no missing product codes; standard units of measure (e.g. ltr, l, litres); no currency issues; correctly spelled vendors; fully classified data; or the right data in the right columns.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, what does this mean?  It means greater visibility across your business in several areas, allowing better decisions, as well as time and cost savings and increased profits.</span></p>\n<p><b>Trustworthy </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">– This is critical.  Business decisions around jobs, staffing, budgets, cost savings and more are all based on data.  Data is used by everyone from the bottom to the top of an organisation. You have to be able to trust that what you’re looking at is the right information, and you need it to be accurate in order for your teams to use the data in their daily jobs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If they don’t trust the data, then they might not use the fancy new expensive software you’ve just spent tens of thousands of pounds installing.  Or the new AI you’ve installed may not produce the right results because it’s learning from dirty data.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like a good coat, data is an investment &#8211; not a cost.  By making sure it has its COAT on, you’re saving time, money and avoiding future problems.  And also like any coat, it needs to be maintained.  You need to continually ensure your data is consistent, organised, accurate and trustworthy to get the most out of it.</span></p>\n<p>About the Author:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With nearly a decade of experience fixing your dirty data, Susan Walsh is <a href=\"https://www.theclassificationguru.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Classification Guru</a>. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She brings clarity and accuracy to data and procurement; helps teams work more effectively and efficiently; and cuts through the jargon to address the issues of dirty data and its consequences in an entertaining and engaging way. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Susan is a specialist in data classification, supplier normalisation, taxonomy development, and data cleansing and can help your business find cost savings through spend and time management &#8211; supporting better, more informed business decisions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can contact her on </span><a href=\"mailto:susan@theclassificationguru.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">susan@theclassificationguru.com</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n",

    "web_content": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Digitization — digitalization — digital transformation. These words have been buzzing around the supply chain world in recent years and have received significant attention the past few months due to COVID-19 disruptions. The current theme in supply chain: adopt digital supply chain tools or be prepared to struggle, if not fail, in the post COVID-19 business world. While I absolutely agree with this statement, the current messaging is a bit misleading, implying, for example, that simply replacing Excel with a cloud-based planning tool will make your supply chain more resilient and, thus, your organization more competitive. However, a truly successful digital business transformation requires several considerations aside from deciding which tools will bring the most value to an organization. Based on my experience implementing cloud-based supply chain planning tools, I’ve categorized and detailed those considerations here. If your company is “good to go” in all three of these areas, then you are ready to get started with technology implementations. If, on the other hand, one of the categories needs some attention, it is highly recommended to give it the attention it needs before spending on implementation fees and user licenses. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Data Readiness </strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consistently clean data is needed to create and refine forecasts, accurately calculate key performance indicators, manage supplier relationships, identify areas for continuous improvement efforts, determine replenishment logic, optimize transportation lanes, increase end-to-end supply chain visibility, and the list goes on. Without the right data in a format that can be consumed by a digital tool, the tool is obsolete. You can quickly become overwhelmed when you consider the many data points needed to drive the supply chain and the effort it would take to clean and prepare data, but not preparing your data before you begin implementing technology only causes more headache and money wasted in the end. If you do not have the resources in-house that can dedicate time to data cleansing, consider outsourcing to a pro. </span></p>\n<p><strong>People Readiness </strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have all heard lessons learned anecdotes of tools that were implemented, but never used. And yet, companies continue to minimize the criticality of thorough training and robust change management. Ensuring users are ready to adopt a new tool is more than making sure they know how to physically use the system. There is an emotional, mental, and dare I say it, spiritual readiness required to effectively navigate change that affects us personally, and this should not be overlooked during the transformation journey. Again, if you don’t have  an in-house training and change management leader, lean on the experts and outsource. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Process Readiness </strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many supply chain tools are highly customizable and very flexible, which is good and bad. Different industries have different technological requirements and I have seen my fair share of variations in planning processes, so having the flexibility to customize tools is beneficial. However, this ability to customize means it is very easy to implement a tool that supports a process that is far from ideal. Taking the time to get all the stakeholders in a room to create, refine and align processes is a must-do before you start the heavy lifting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Data, people and process are the legs of the three-legged business transformation stool and are all equally important. When we hear consultants and industry leaders talk about digital supply chain tools, it is easy to get excited about the value technology can bring to the supply chain. However, now, more than ever, is the time to remember that technology itself will not perform miracles and a simultaneous investment in people and data improvements is where ROI is realized.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dyci Manns Sfregola holds a Masters in Engineering Management from Kennesaw State University’s Southern Polytechnic College of Engineering. She spent the early part of her career in digital and experiential marketing before transitioning to supply chain. She is currently a consultant focused on Connected Planning process improvement and leveraging cloud-based technology to achieve supply chain excellence.</span></p>\n",

    "web_content": "<p>Everyone knows what a Sales Manager, Operations Director and a Logistics Manager does.</p>\n<p>Not many people understand what <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/procurement-time-to-protect-your-supply-chain/\">Procurement</a> is and what we do, as can be evidenced when I meet people at gatherings of professionals at events such as expat meetups or non-industry related conferences.</p>\n<p>These 4 functions, along with Finance, are essentially the departments that add value to, and bring home the bacon in any organisation engaged in producing or distributing anything. Others, such as IT, HR and Legal, are typically overheads which are necessary to run any business but rarely contribute a great deal to bottom-line growth.</p>\n<p>In today’s very uncertain economic outlook, driving value through smart procurement could mean the difference between a company surviving or thriving, rather than struggling or even folding.</p>\n<p>When I tell someone I’m a Procurement Consultant, a rather puzzled look usually ensues, followed by a “what’s that?”</p>\n<p>I then usually say something like “Well, it’s kind of the opposite to what a Business Development Manager does.” If I’m still getting a confused look, then the sentence “I help SMEs reduce and optimise what they spend so they can increase their bottom line margins without selling more or raising their prices” usually helps them to have some sort of idea.</p>\n<p>And therein lies the problem at large of getting procurement to have a bigger influence on companies’ bottom line, especially once you get out of the corporate world and into smaller and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).</p>\n<p>Not many businesses once you get below the $50 million mark have strategic procurement as an in-house function. Every SME (US English: SMB) knows what they sell. Yet hardly any TRULY have a grip on what they BUY.</p>\n<p>In the words of perma-tanned Welsh crooner Sir Tom Jones, it’s not unusual. Quite the norm in fact. And when you think about it, this is madness.</p>\n<p>Let’s take the average medium-sized manufacturing business with a $20 million annual turnover and around 100 employees.</p>\n<p>If they’re producing something, then typically around 60% of their turnover will consist of goods and services purchased from external vendors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Raw materials</li>\n<li>Operating supplies (MRO and consumables)</li>\n<li>Sales, marketing, administrative and regulatory expenses (SG&amp;A)</li>\n<li>Logistics &amp; distribution</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Add on top of this about a quarter of their turnover that is made up of labour costs in the form of salaried employees and temporary workers.</p>\n<p>Which then leaves circa 15%, or $3 million, left over as pre-tax profit.</p>\n<p>The numbers will differ slightly from business to business, but these are pretty typical for your average manufacturing company.</p>\n<p>So, this then begs the uncomfortable question of who is managing this $12 million they are spending on goods and services from external suppliers?</p>\n<p>Just like a company wouldn’t send their EHS Engineer or HR Manager to a customer field sales visit, neither should these team members be allowed anywhere near a supplier negotiation or request for quotation.</p>\n<p>The Warehouse Manager shouldn’t be negotiating a forklift truck lease. And the Systems Administrator definitely shouldn’t be negotiating with Microsoft or Oracle.</p>\n<p>And yet they do. This is crazy.</p>\n<p>Now, before I go on, let’s tackle the point that some of these companies probably have a staff member who does most of the “buying”. By that I mean placing purchase orders, chasing up deliveries, dealing with suppliers who haven’t been paid or invoices that accounts have misplaced, or fighting off price increases.</p>\n<p>This is an administrative rather than a strategic role. It’s operational day-to-day purchasing. It adds no intrinsic value and is a transactional, reactive function which in any case will likely be done by a robot in 10 years’ time.</p>\n<p>So, let’s go back to the $12 million of spend in this fictitious business that’s being managed by a hotchpotch of stakeholders who are not experienced procurement professionals.</p>\n<p>Let’s run some rough calculations. About 50% of this spend ($6 million) will either be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Under contract, and therefore untouchable for now. Many facilities services such as catering, security and cleaning will fall under this umbrella, for example.</li>\n<li>Or heavily driven by the price of raw materials and thus completely dependent upon market traded commodities. The best buyer in the world won’t be able to negotiate steel, copper or electricity below the market price.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, the balance of the remaining $6 million is what we’ll call “addressable spend” &#8211; i.e. NOT heavily market price driven and NOT untouchable due to contractual commitments.</p>\n<p><strong>At least 5% savings should be achievable</strong> on spend which has never been managed, negotiated and interrogated by an experienced procurement professional. This is actually a fairly conservative number in all honesty.</p>\n<p>On a business that turns over $20 million and makes $3 million (15%) in pre-tax profit, <strong>the $300k that a skilled procurement professional could deliver to this organisation in savings would represent a 10% increase to its bottom line.</strong></p>\n<p>Not bad in a time when sales are flatlining at best, or quite possibly tumbling!</p>\n<p>The bright, shiny object that is marketing won’t rescue ailing businesses during a recession when nobody out there is buying anything. Price increases will be off the table for a while too in a deflationary environment.</p>\n<p>When times are hard, the only way a company can dig itself out of a hole is to either innovate or cut costs….but cut the <strong><em>right ones</em></strong>. Investing in some procurement help is going to be way more conducive to an organisation’s long-term survival than firing their best people or slashing training or strategic capex budgets.</p>\n<p>So, if you’d never heard Procurement or didn’t know what we did as a profession, I hope now you do. Even more so, if you’re a board member of an SME/SMB, then I hope you can see the value that an experienced procurement professional can add to your organisation’s bottom line results.</p>\n<p>Now more than ever is the time to go out and leverage this massive, gaping opportunity to get one step ahead of your competitors!</p>\n<h3><strong>About the Author:</strong></h3>\n<p>James Meads is a Europe-based independent procurement consultant, helping SMEs to increase their bottom line by driving value through strategic sourcing and spend management.

    "web_content": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fourth industrial revolution is here. Are you prepared? Industry 4.0 brings both challenges and opportunities as it offers a new way to organize and control the entire value chain, enabling you to customize based on customer requirements. Manufacturing is now more than ever dependent upon <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/key-takeaways-from-collision-2019-the-future-of-procurement/\">digital transformation</a> to remain competitive and agile. But many in the industry don’t have a clear path for implementing and planning for Industry 4.0.</span></p>\n<h2><b>What Does Industry 4.0 Mean for Manufacturers?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two words describe what Industry 4.0 means to manufacturers: integration and collaboration. Technology has enabled manufacturing to become truly connected, leveraging robotics, the Internet of Things (IoT), software as a service (SaaS), and AI and machine learning. What </span><a href=\"https://www.optessa.com/blog/industry-4-0-history-technology-business-transformation/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Industry 4.0</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can offer is a way to integrate all these innovations, providing opportunities for growth and easy scalability.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The transformation available to manufacturers can be complex. There are many considerations that all lead to change. Change is hard, and what you’ll need is a practical and actionable road map.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Planning and Implementing Industry 4.0: Key Steps</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These critical steps will help you build a path to Industry 4.0.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Where Are You?</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You have to start with the state of your current operations. While it would be nice to leapfrog to Industry 4.0, you need to ensure you’ve effectively adopted Industry 3.0, which includes investment in automation, computers, and electronics. It’s essential to have information technology and operational technology working together, instead of in silos.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This foundation must be in place before you can move to the next revolution. The key difference between Industry 3.0 and 4.0 is data. Industry 3.0 has been generating data, but it hasn’t been used to streamline processes. Now there’s the chance to do so.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Develop Your Strategy</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you know where you are, you can work on how to get to the implementation of Industry 4.0 strategy. One critical aspect of the strategy has to be connectivity. You must have digital connectivity between machines and computers so that the data can be collected and analyzed. Without aggregation and analysis, data doesn’t mean much.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In creating your strategy, you must have a plan for collecting and analyzing data. The process should also be automated, eliminating manual activities. Data is a vital factor in moving to smart manufacturing. You need to know why identical machines perform differently so you can proactively maintain or alter assets.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your strategy will also need to address the potential roadblocks ahead, such as disjointed data collection or the lack of a central hub for your big data.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Ensure Your Ecosystem Is Ready</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What’s the biggest obstacle in most transformations? Communication. Industry 4.0 is no different. The physical and digital parts of your organization must communicate. Without this, it’s just a cycle of disconnection. If your environment isn’t ready, the drive for change will be rejected.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Test Out Your Approach</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once your strategy is ready, it’s time to execute. Think small at first to test your approach. Your plant has numerous machines and workflows. Narrow in on a specific challenge such as integrating legacy systems or establishing a unified data model.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both issues can cause havoc to your plan to implement Industry 4.0. You can’t just throw out everything existing and start new. Your current environment must evolve, so starting with one critical component sets you up for future success.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Concentrate on Process Improvements</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The end goal for implementing Industry 4.0 is to improve every process, making it as efficient as possible and ensuring that you are optimizing resources. Look at the entire process from beginning to end. Identify where opportunities for improvement exist that can be supported by communication, connectivity, and data.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A process doesn’t just include machines. It’s also about personnel. To have any marked progress, you will need to invest in training for your team as well as software and hardware.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Industry 4.0: Priority One</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Planning for and implementing Industry 4.0 won&#8217;t be easy. It’s also not a linear path. You’ll need help and support along the way.

    "web_content": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Managing tail spend has been an important topic for sourcing and supply chain professionals for the past several years. In most companies, external spending has a Pareto-like distribution – the largest 20% of suppliers (by dollar volume) account for about 80% of the total external spend. Tail spend is generally defined as the 20% (or so) of the total external spend that is attributable to the smallest 80% of suppliers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tail spend is primarily associated with indirect spend categories. In a 2017 study by Spend Matters, the typical company had about $1 billion in total indirect spend and 9,374 indirect suppliers. Using the 80/20 rule, about $800 million of the indirect spend would be concentrated in 1,875 suppliers, while the remaining $200 million – the tail – would be spread across about 7,500 suppliers.</span></p>\n<p><b>The Tail Spend Catch-22</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tail spend presents a classic Catch-22 for sourcing and supply chain professionals. When it’s not professionally managed, the result is often overspending and missed opportunities for cost savings. But because tail spend typically encompasses a large volume of relatively low-value purchases, managing the tail can consume a disproportionate amount of time and effort. So while bringing tail spend under professional management can produce direct cost savings, it can also lead to higher indirect procurement costs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of this conundrum, companies have used a variety of tools and techniques to manage tail spend, including e-procurement applications, public and private e-marketplaces, and commercial purchasing cards. None of these techniques is comprehensive, and some industry experts have criticized this approach as piecemeal. But in reality, tail spend encompasses such diverse goods, services, and types of purchases that it’s not realistic to expect any one tool or technique to work well across the entire tail spend spectrum.</span></p>\n<p><b>Solving the Print Tail Spend Conundrum </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Printed materials and marketing services are major components of tail spend at many companies. Most large and mid-size enterprises buy printing and marketing services hundreds – if not thousands – of times every year. The supply chain for printing and marketing services is usually fragmented, and purchases are typically made by several organizational units and business functions spread across the entire enterprise. Many of these purchases are relatively small (in terms of dollar amounts), and most involve custom products or services that are true one-off purchases.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, purchases of printing and marketing services can be challenging for procurement leaders to manage efficiently. Fortunately, print e-sourcing technology solutions can enable companies to take control of this part of their tail spend. Enterprise-class print e-sourcing solutions are purpose built to support the procurement of virtually all kinds of printed materials, as well as a wide range of creative and marketing services.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A capable print e-sourcing solution will deliver several financial and operational benefits, but in our work with dozens of clients, we’ve identified three financial benefits that sourcing and supply chain leaders routinely say are particularly valuable.</span></p>\n<p><b><i>Direct Cost Savings – </i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The use of a print e-sourcing solution will reduce the direct costs of printing and marketing services by 14% to 22% in most companies. Print e-sourcing solutions drive direct cost savings primarily by making it easy for companies to use competitive bidding on a widespread basis. When companies initially implement a print e-sourcing solution and expand their use of competitive bidding, the direct cost savings can be considerably higher than 14% to 22%. In our work with clients, we often see pro forma cost savings of 30% to 50% based on an analysis of previous purchases that were made without competitive bidding.</span></p>\n<p><b><i>Indirect Cost Savings – </i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As noted earlier, one of the key challenges in managing tail spend is dealing with a large volume of small purchases without significantly increasing indirect procurement costs. A print e-sourcing solution reduces indirect costs by streamlining the work activities and processes required to manage and execute purchases of printing and marketing services. In effect, a print e-sourcing solution increases the number of purchases that a buyer can effectively manage. Evidence indicates that a buyer using a print e-sourcing solution can manage up to six times more purchases than a buyer using manual methods.</span></p>\n<p><b><i>Improved Spend Visibility – </i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because printing and marketing services are often purchased by numerous departments and business functions, many companies don’t have accurate or comprehensive information about how much they are spending on such products and services. Poor spend visibility is an important issue because it often contributes to overspending. A print e-sourcing solution centralizes the data regarding spending on printing and marketing services and provides company leaders complete visibility regarding the amount and nature of that spending.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tail spend will always be part of the sourcing landscape. To improve the management of tail spend, sourcing and supply chain professionals will need to use a variety of techniques and <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/season2-episode12/\">technology</a> tools. Print e-sourcing solutions provide an effective way to reduce the costs of printing and marketing services, and can enable companies to tame this unruly component of their tail spend.</span></p>\n<p>ABOUT THE AUTHOR:</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sarah Scudder is president of Real Sourcing Network (</span><a href=\"https://rsnetwork.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RSN</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), a print and marketing sourcing tool software company.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sarah Scudder has spunk.

    "web_content": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This time there are no instructions for use! After nearly 30 years of experience in Supply in France &amp; Europe (B2B &amp; B2C), I have never seen anything like it, a deconstruction of almost all the supply chains in less than a month… For 3 weeks now, we have been confined and every day we discover a new difficulty to execute a logistics step : reduction of the postal service for parcels, complete closure of the relay points networks, reduction of rail transport, cargo blockage in ports, slowing down of road transit at the borders etc… It is a new page to be written every morning to maintain the logistics chains and in particular essential ones such as food, health but also all the important services (fire department, security, energy, cleanliness, maintenance etc…). Being for once a few weeks ahead of North America in this pandemic, and in view of this unprecedented situation for all of us on this scale, I wished to humbly share with you some of the measures or initiatives we are observing here in Europe. I hope that this may help some of your companies on the American continent to better cope with this unprecedented wave of upheaval.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a phase of astonishment and incomprehension in the face of the decision for strict national confinement (closure of schools, restaurants etc…) and the massive development of telework for all, we observed a collapse in a few days of road transport flows with a drop of around 50 to 70% outside food and essentials products (health, medicines etc…).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the production crisis in China, the health crisis and the closure of our factories here in Europe, it is now the effects of the crisis of our local demand (companies &amp; individuals). The logistics chain is therefore affected at both ends and in its productive step, which immediately led to major dysfunctions such as overstocking linked to the disaffection of customer’s consumption or the closure of stores such furniture stores. There was also population migration out of towns with a transfer of food consumption to rural or holiday areas leading to a disorganization of the logistics of mass distribution. Thus, large peri-urban supermarkets that require travel by car have seen a decline in attendance in favour of small local food stores. It is thus estimated that Paris lost about 20% of its population in the 48 hours just before confinement.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All this confirms that no one can say what will happen to the flows in the next 4 to 6 weeks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Faced with these intense troubles, the <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/no-toilet-paper-supply-chain-to-the-rescue/\">supply chain</a> manager must reinvent his approach and change many of his habits:</span></p>\n<p><b>REFLEXION</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:</span></p>\n<p><b>Scripting &amp; Analysis</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Imagine different scenarios for each of the following deadlines:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Short term 2 to 6 weeks,</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Medium term 2 to 3 months,</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prepare a recovery plan for the time of containment release.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the current context, so random and unpredictable, it is advisable to analyze its historical data (Purchasing, Procurement, Customer orders etc… ) to then build several scenarios for each of the deadlines. Today’s technological tools can largely help to simulate the impacts.</span></p>\n<p><b>Decompose</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then the decomposition of the complete cycle of an order allows to see which are the current zones of fragility or too strong dependence on a single actor.</span></p>\n<p><b>Prepare</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It becomes possible to prepare arrangements to be made according to each scenario and no longer just undergo and try to regain some small margins in your organization. Setting up a crisis cockpit for your Supply Chain is a way to gather key information to be monitored on a daily basis. </span></p>\n<p><b>ACTION</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, we are now observing new hazards, and our scenarios are obviously not right, so we have to act daily without hesitation and resort to:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Agility every day to adjust your Supply with the latest data available; you have to be inventive, very pragmatic and use common sense to think outside de box; creativity and imagination are experiencing a new dynamic. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cooperation with your colleagues, suppliers, customers, with neighbouring companies even If they are from a different sector.  It is time to cross and share your difficulties to see if the expertise of other sectors can help to find new solutions and compensate for unavailable materials or products, complementary or alternative means of transport etc….</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, as we are all concerned, see if you can help with your operational infrastructure and your Supply skills, the health sector which is suffering a lot with the massive influx of sick people and which doesn’t have infinite means in logistics to manage this crisis.

    "web_content": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">America, along with the rest of the world, is in uncharted territory as an international pandemic meets a global economy. Businesses large and small are being immensely impacted by travel restrictions, quarantines, school closings, and mandated closures of businesses to stop the coronavirus.  </span></p>\n<p><b></b><a href=\"https://www.fundera.com/blog/small-business-employment-and-growth-statistics\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><b>There are 30.2 million small businesses in the United States, as an example.</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This makes up 99.9% of all businesses in the United States employing 58.9 million people – 47.5% of the total workforce.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With these small businesses at the heart of many of our supply chains, it is critically important for Procurement and Supply Chain professionals to understand the impact this crisis is having on their small and diverse businesses.  In fact, as stated by </span><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/nextavenue/2020/03/23/how-the-coronavirus-is-impacting-small-business-owners/#56f71701473a\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forbes</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on March 23rd, “a National Small Business Association member survey last week found that three in four small-business owners are very concerned about the economic impact of COVID-19.

Those could be facilities services providers, your manufacturers of unique products, your promotional item suppliers, your caterers, your recruiters, your staffing firms, the nonprofits that support your businesses, shall I go on?  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With small business owners focusing on keeping their businesses afloat, making the hard choices to lay off their workforces, many of them being personal friends, and trying to figure out what is around the next corner for them, there is little time for them to focus on the many funding options that the federal and local governments offer, as well as private options that are available.  Luckily, there are many options for business owners at this time, but sorting through the options and understanding how to apply accurately is not as simple.</span></p>\n<p><b><i>The Good News:</i></b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To help protect the small businesses of the United States during this time of crisis, the Small Business Administration has issued an Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) declaration. This declaration makes loans up to $2 million in assistance available to small businesses and non-profit organizations.  The interest rate is 3.75% or 2.75% for non-profits. With payback terms of 15 or 30 years, as selected by the SBA, that would amount to about $4,500/month per million for 30 years or $7,300/month per million for the 15-year term at the 3.75% interest rate. Most US based privately held and non-profit companies qualify for the loan, as long as the SBA determines 1) eligibility; 2) satisfactory credit; and 3) repayment ability.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are other programs being passed to also help small businesses at the state and local level, and they vary by state to state. It is best that your suppliers check with their governor’s office on the options available to them.  There are also an increasing amount of loans and grants available through private industry. These options are sometimes targeted for certain industries or groups of companies; however, they are an option to potentially explore.  </span></p>\n<p><b><i>The Not So Good News:</i></b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bottom line, at this time, the most robust offering is through the SBA, and demand is high for these loans.  In the over 60+ year history of the SBA, they have never had to manage this program to serve a national need.  Historically, this program was used for local or regional disasters like a tornado, hurricane, or fire. And unlike the standard SBA loan process through PLP’s/banks, the EIDL applications are submitted directly to the SBA for underwriting and are funded directly by the Treasury.  Given the high demand for this program, the SBA is trying to help as many as they can, but wait times are understandably long, and their website is feeling the impacts of the amount of demand, with outages occurring.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From working with many business owners through the application process to date, the application process is not as easy as it would seem.  We have also had conversations with many business owners who have already submitted, but submitted unknowingly incorrectly, which could cause delays and a reduced loan amount.  Unfortunately, when that occurs, there is no clear path forward to make the needed corrections. </span></p>\n<p><b><i>How You Can Help:</i></b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Procurement and Supply Chain professionals, it should be our mission right now to help protect our suppliers from shuttering their businesses for the long term.  For our supply chains to reactivate in their full capacities, we need our suppliers to be ready and able to meet demands. Here are three ways to help:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b><i>Be proactive.</i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  Do not assume that if you do not hear a supplier is struggling that they are ok.  They are not. Assume that at least 38% of your suppliers are on the brink of failure. From working with many suppliers who are struggling as we speak, their customers are some of the last people they will tell, in fear of long-term impacts or, frankly, because of pride.  </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b><i>Encourage Education</i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  Your suppliers need to be educated on the options available to them.  There are many free webinars being offered by Chambers of Commerce, by the SBA themselves, and Economic Development organizations.  </span><b>HPP is also hosting live</b> <b>webinars, with SBA representatives attending every Tuesday and Thursday to help educate business owners.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b><i>Ensure Accuracy</i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  When your suppliers start the application process for these loans, particularly for the SBA loan, they need to understand that it is critically important for their applications to be filled out accurately and that includes a narrative with the application explaining the need and the amount they are seeking.  </span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/procurement-never-heard-of-us-we-can-probably-save-your-business/\">Procurement</a> is at the forefront of helping rebuild the economies across the globe and here in the United States.  This is a mission and a calling that many of us have never considered in our careers. It is time to lead, be proactive, and serve those small businesses that have served us for so long.  </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amanda Prochaska is the CEO and co-Founder of HPP, Inc.  The HPP Business Recovery Program is here to assist business owners to collect all required documentation, organize needed financials and tax documents, and advise in the Disaster Business Loan Application process.  For more information about the HPP Business Recovery Program and available webinars, please visit </span></i><a href=\"https://hppcoach.com/hpp-business-recovery-program/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-schema-attribute=\"\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HPP Business Recovery Program.</span></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

    "web_content": "<p>As the CoronaVirus runs across the world, everyone is suddenly being exposed to news story after news story focusing on Supply Chains.</p>\n<p>For an activity that usually doesn&#8217;t get this much attention, it’s both great and terrible at the same time.</p>\n<p>As someone who has spent 13 years of my life in the Supply Chain world, it is normal that your friends, family and other professionals don&#8217;t really get what you do. This is completely normal, I don&#8217;t profess to know all about financial markets, software development, sales or any other professions for that matter.</p>\n<p>The challenge with this however, comes as we experience <a href=\"https://themusingevolution.blogspot.com/2020/03/the-black-swan.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Black Swan</a> type events &#8230; suddenly there is all kinds of media coverage, conversation and opinions being shared and not always with all of the facts (or at the very least, facts that for the majority of people are out of context, so then can become misunderstood).</p>\n<p>This post will be high level overview and will help provide a general framework for Supply Chain Operations. I will highlight how this relates to the current &#8220;out of stock&#8221; items that we are seeing throughout the grocery industry (this is a major area where consumer behaviour has impacted the Supply Chain and is being largely misunderstood).</p>\n<p>With that, let&#8217;s jump in.</p>\n<h2>Supply Chain 101</h2>\n<p>Right off the bat, let&#8217;s get an official definition for &#8220;Supply Chain&#8221;</p>\n<p>Supply chain is a system of organizations, people, activities, information, and resources involved in moving a product or service from supplier to customer. Supply chain activities involve the transformation of natural resources, raw materials, and components into a finished product that is delivered to the end customer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1</a></p>\n<p>In the context of food, this means:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sourcing your core ingredients (i.e. from the farm)</li>\n<li>Transporting those ingredients to a manufacturing/transformation facility</li>\n<li>Packaging the final product</li>\n<li>Warehousing (storing) the finished goods</li>\n<li>Delivering finished goods &#8211; either to a retailer (or direct to consumer)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once at a grocery store:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unloading the truck</li>\n<li>Opening shipping containers</li>\n<li>Merchandising the Shelf</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are two ways product get to a grocery store, either by direct to store delivery (DSD) by a manufacturer or wholesaler (traditionally fast moving goods that are perishable, as freshness is paramount) or facilitated through the retailer’s own warehouse and store fulfillment network (usually dry goods, canned food, etc). What’s important to understand here is that a truck at a store’s loading dock either is delivering a specific type of product (i.e. eggs) or if the majority of the inventory on the truck is for the store, it is to replenish the whole grocery store (rarely would a truckload of one item every pass through one store).</p>\n<h3>Demand Planning</h3>\n<p>Every item on a shelf starts with the same process, <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/sea-2-ep-95-a-family-perspective-on-supply-and-demand-planning/\">demand planning</a>.</p>\n<p>Demand planning is the process of forecasting the demand for a product or service so it can be produced and delivered more efficiently and to the satisfaction of customers. Demand planning is considered an essential step in supply chain planning <a href=\"https://searcherp.techtarget.com/definition/demand-planning\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2</a></p>\n<p>In basic English, demand planning is a series of checks and balances that are essentially a best guess as to what consumers will buy and when.</p>\n<p>That is not being critical of the demand planning process, but since end consumers don&#8217;t buy consumable household items far in advance (creating the opportunity to make to order) planners use past sales trends, current market conditions and future feature (promotional) activity to predict the inventory a store will need.</p>\n<h3>Manufacturing</h3>\n<p>Now that we “know” what we need in the market, it’s time to make it.</p>\n<p>Fact, physical manufacturing plants have a maximum capacity they can produce over a period of time, basically, you can only do so much in 24 hours.</p>\n<p>This is an important distinction compared to the software industry for example. When Netflix sees an unexpected serge in demand, they are able to log into their Amazon Web Services and with a few clicks double or triple their available capacity in a seamless way <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/netflix-case-study/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">3</a>.</p>\n<p>Physical manufacturing is not like this. Modern production plants are filled with specialized machines that have been designed to perform exact functions. They are generally built to perform long production runs and have a maximum throughput (if you have an extra 6 minutes, check out what it takes to make the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRrWZVtibXw\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">erasers</a> you buy at the dollar store!)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Warehousing</h3>\n<p>With everything made, it’s time to park it.</p>\n<p>Based on the facility, product may be stored on property at the production facility or finished goods may need to be shipped out to an intermediary <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/season2-episode32/\">warehouse</a> to facilitate delivery to the stores.</p>\n<p>A lot of people think that this is the opportunity to make sure a product is never out of stock. If all it takes to make sure that a product is always available is to fill up the warehouse, just do that.</p>\n<p>The issue here is twofold, the shear volume of skus (products) available today for consumers and varying rates of sale. To come back to our grocery example, a supercentre grocery store can carry between 15,000 and 40,000 unique skus, that is A LOT of warehouse space.</p>\n<p>The warehouse environment is also a varied one. More technology and automation is always being incorporated, however there still can be a lot of manual intervention required in order to successfully pick, pack and ship products to stores. Similar to manufacturing, a warehouse has a maximum rate of flow before it bottlenecks.</p>\n<h3>Delivery</h3>\n<p>Once what you need is in the warehouse, we have to get it to the stores so you can buy it.</p>\n<p>Everything that you see in a store gets there by a truck. This means that product is loaded and driven to specific stores and delivered one by one.</p>\n<p>Trucks are either loaded with product all for one store or they have partial orders for multiple stores (anywhere from 2 to 7 stores depending on the product type). Think of any major city, think of how many grocery stores that you know of and match that up with how many drivers are trucks are needed to service them regularly.</p>\n<p>How much time you are able to deliver is an important aspect as well. Depending on the city, deliveries may be able to happen 24 hours a day, or some might be restricted by by-laws and only allow deliveries during a specific period of the day.</p>\n<p>Another complicating factor is that heavy vehicle operators are bound by hours of service regulations; this means that a driver is only allowed to be on the road for a specific number of hours before having to clock out.</p>\n<h3>Receiving at the Store</h3>\n<p>The final piece to seeing product on the shelf is store receiving. Each store has to have a truck back up to it, unload the pallets of product, and are taken into store inventory.</p>\n<p>Stores also need to have available staff and availability to restock their shelves. While stores receive pallets of goods, consumers typically buy individual units, this is a lot of unpacking and merchandising that goes on &#8230; daily.</p>\n<h2>So why are shelves empty?</h2>\n<p>There can be many reasons / breaks in the chain as to why a particular product is not available on the shelf when you want to buy it.</p>\n<p>With respect to the grocery industry and<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6646452066925494273\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> COVID-19</a>, the answer is simple; the rate of sale exceeded the rate of movement through the Supply Chain.</p>\n<p>Panic buying created a tsunami of demand that complete blew out the demand plan that was in place, there is no way that the system would be able to keep up to such a rapid and unexpected change (products like toilet paper for example).</p>\n<p>While most Supply Chains are robust enough that you could plan for anything, proper planning would mean that you would have to KNOW in advance what was going to happen (and have a pretty good level of accuracy as well). While some out there might say that they did in fact know, hindsight is 20/20.</p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE &#8211; Please keep in mind that just because there is a LAG in the chain, it does not mean that product is unavailable in the chain</strong></p>\n<h2>How can you help?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>STOP panic buying &amp; hoarding\n<ul>\n<li>This activity only continues to create unpredictable rates of sale, you are helping the problem stay alive when you do this</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Buy less in general\n<ul>\n<li>Most people have a lot in their pantries</li>\n<li>The average person needs between 1,500 and 2,000 calories a day &#8211; a 1KG tub of peanut butter has 5,880 calories, or can fully sustain a person for 3 days of full activity</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Shop multiple stores if possible (at a normal rate)\n<ul>\n<li>Different grocers have different supply chains, while you might need to run around a bit, you will find different items at each location</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Don&#8217;t buffer\n<ul>\n<li>If something was out of stock, don&#8217;t buy 2 or 3 the next time you are in the store &#8220;just in case&#8221;</li>\n<li>With everyone creating their own buffer inventory, stores are not getting an accurate picture of what people really need.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There&#8217;s a whole other side to this equation that impacts from the store&#8217;s side (we can leave this for another time), as they too are trying to order and plan to meet consumer demand; the more erratic the consumer behaviour, the harder it is for them to order.</p>\n<p>Everyone benefits if we just slow down and let the system catch up.</p>\n<p>I was at a few stores last week, while there are gaps and missing product, it is already getting better and will continue as our shopping behaviour relaxes.</p>\n<p>Please do your part so that no one is left missing something that they might actually NEED.</p>\n",

    "web_content": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Imagine you work at a famous tech company, about to launch your next category-killing gadget. You announce the launch date with great fanfare. You&#8217;ve instructed suppliers to prepare for a 10% increase in production. Stores are primed with glossy marketing materials. Journalists, investors, and customers are excited.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then Coronavirus hits.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Chinese government scrambles to contain the outbreak. Workers are barred from leaving their homes. Transport routes slow down and close. Your expensive, well-planned product launch date is well and truly in danger.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do you do?</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Surprise Avoidance Strategy.</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The above story is real[1]. The company is Apple and the product is the new iPhone. Apple has consistently been ranked as having the most advanced supply chain in the world, using every advanced supply chain technology you could imagine, and even they get supply chain surprises.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if you’re not Apple, this type of challenge — a sudden change that disrupts your supply chain — is familiar. Most execs know that Supply Chain Surprises are a fact of life. Some you can avoid but many you can&#8217;t.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unavoidable surprises must be met with focus. You need time and clarity of mind to react well and manage appropriately.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avoidable surprises must be met with a shift in tactics. You need to consider why you couldn&#8217;t avoid the surprise. This also takes time and clarity of mind.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike Apple, many of us don’t have the luxury of huge budgets and unlimited technical resources; in fact, Gartner reports[2] that only 4% of Supply Chains operate with de-siloed organizations and with full visibility across the journey.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In my view, there are three main reasons for this. One, the technology that drives this change in logistics has traditionally been expensive and requires an all-or-nothing buy in. Two, many report that technology purchases have not lived up to their promise, which makes others shy to buy in. Finally, people aren&#8217;t sure where to start &#8211; a new transport management system, or a new ERP? Visibility Software or Inventory Management?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don&#8217;t wait until you&#8217;re Apple-sized to start upgrading your supply chain. The best place to start is by addressing avoidable surprises.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to upgrade your supply chain without breaking the bank:</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is there a pragmatic way to start surprise-proofing your business? Yes. Here&#8217;s how.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Get rid of useless work.</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of us have slack in our day if we look for it, and a time-audit is the best way to find it. Think about the tasks that you repeat again and again, and figure out how you can cut them down or eliminate them altogether.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For people who work in ocean freight, for example, the most common way to see the status of a shipment is to go to a steamship line website or a port terminal and do manual searches. This one is a double whammy — it takes hours of time every day that you aren&#8217;t spending on more strategic tasks AND it can cause more surprises to occur: small mistakes or oversights can cause demurrage fees to rack up and cause delays.</span></p>\n<p><b>Using a tool like </b><a href=\"https://www.terminal49.com/?utm_source=ltsc&amp;utm_medium=blog_post&amp;utm_campaign=supply_chain_surprises\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Terminal 49</b></a><b> will save you hours of manual, error-prone busywork each week, and allow you to focus strictly on the information that you need to know. </b></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Invest in a component that can help you see surprises before they become a problem.</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Supply Chain Visibility tools provide the vital service of telling you where your cargo is. They are extremely valuable in helping you avoid the kinds of surprises you can plan around.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, only 6% of companies report that they have full visibility into their supply chain[3]. This number is small because, traditionally, getting visibility into all modes of transport can be costly and require huge IT implementations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But you don&#8217;t always need full visibility all the time. You can grow your visibility into each part of the chain, then connect the dots later.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thankfully, it&#8217;s 2020. There are now a growing number of SCV (supply chain visibility) software tools that provide visibility into aspects of your supply chain without requiring complex integrations. </span></p>\n<p><b>For example, while you’re searching for the perfect tool for Rail insights, you can track your cargo on the ocean and at port on </b><a href=\"https://www.terminal49.com/?utm_source=ltsc&amp;utm_medium=blog_post&amp;utm_campaign=supply_chain_surprises\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Terminal 49</b></a><b> with almost no implementation efforts at all. </b><b>Start small, and grow. </b></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Integrate visibility data into the systems you actually use.</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you have some visibility, start pushing that data where it needs to go.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many IT systems fail because teams don&#8217;t end up using them &#8211; perhaps the system lacks crucial info, or it’s too hard to use.

    "web_content": "<p>Disruptions are the new normal in our lives and in global supply chain it’s no different if you consider all the challenges occurring in the manufacturing/tech sector. Out of the box thinking is the new normal. Increasing tensions between the world’s largest manufacturing country and the world’s biggest market have created a never before seen manufacturing capacity challenge for countries that have been in some way supporting these giants. In countries like Vietnam, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Cambodia there is a limited production capacity to replace China as was mentioned recently by one of the biggest sourcing and manufacturing providers for fashion and apparel Li &amp; Fung Ltd. Group CEO Spencer Fung recently in a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-09/trade-war-threatens-chinese-factories-existence-li-fung-says\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg.</a> Interview. An important manufacturing volume that started moving TO China 20 years ago is now moving out.</p>\n<p>In a recent keynote at the Panama Supply Chain Forum 2019 by Terry Esper, Ph.D. Associate Professor of Logistics at The Ohio State University Fisher College of Business, explained the “I want it now” effect created by Amazon’s entry into the market. High tech product manufacturing is becoming commoditized (low margins, scaling consumption levels and permanent innovation/changes) and will therefore be less inclined to pay high transportation costs associated with airfreight and/or express shipments. Additionally, long lead times and slow transit times associated with ocean freight from Asia to Latin America, would seem to put Brazil and Mexico out of the picture due to the challenges of just supplying their local markets. Can you have a new place for manufacturing for the rest of the region excluding these two large markets? There is an urgent need but the question is where?</p>\n<p>Due to local historical restrictions and unique market requirements, companies that wanted to do business in Brazil, one of the biggest markets in Latin America, had to establish operations and manufacturing plants in Brazil, thereby becoming an almost self-sufficient country in terms of the sourcing for goods. This has created a very unique market that has developed its own ecosystem for manufacturing as well as technology and innovation creation. Brazil therefore has the three main elements for this kind of a market: the manufacturing capacity, the technology and most importantly, the domestic market. We learned more details recently during an outstanding presentation made by Leandro Santos, General Manager and Operations Vice President for Flex Brazil. During the Panama Supply Chain Forum 2019 in Panama City, Panama this past August, Santos explained that an innovation and manufacturing giant like Flex is always looking for opportunities to  add value for their global customers by satisfying productions and innovation demand, reducing costs, looking for efficiencies, shortening the time from a manufacturing order to delivery of the product to the end customer and being a responsible steward of the environment through a circular economy concept, executing as a new way of doing business. We also learned that Flex is looking to develop cutting edge strategies such as that of using a new breed of regional manufacturing plants that incorporate: robotics, 3D printing and AI supported systems in a regional hub which will make a significant difference by accomplishing their organization’s and customers business goals.</p>\n<p>Here is where Panama becomes a focus for Flex. In October 2018 Flex strategically established a partnership with the fastest growing 3PL in the Latin American region, Logistics Services Panama (LSP). The strategic partnership is designed to provide value added services and customization of Hi-Tech products for one of their global clients that is also an existing LSP client. Flex quickly learned that by operating through their partners in the Colon Free Trade Zone Flex could access an agile, flexible, secure and reliable in Latin America regional distribution hub while also exploring how efficient this hub can be for sourcing components and raw material from suppliers all over the world. The answer to their requirement was obvious: for countries that are not self-sufficient in Hi Tech manufacturing in Latin America mainly Brazil or Mexico, Panama can be the place to move this 4.0 version of manufacturing thereby solving a series of challenges in a single move.</p>\n<p>Chinese tech giant Huawei has also setup a final customization and configuration center for their network infrastructure goods in Panama’s Colon Free Trade Zone. Huawei’s orders for a cell phone network project in the region is configured in Panama using the combination of theirs as well as their vendors’ products so the project is customized for installation before leaving Panama to final destination. Who knows with the global tensions and 5G getting closer and closer maybe Huawei’s the next step could be also doing some manufacturing in Panama as well? Let’s see.</p>\n<p>Panama has logistics in its DNA if you consider that over 30% of its GDP comes from logistics related activities as well as having the busiest ports in Latin America as measured by TEUs. The Panama Canal, The Hub of the Americas at the Tocumen International Airport, the Colon Free Trade Zone and other special economic zones add ingredients to the mix. Aided by the shortest distance between the Atlantic and Pacific ocean in the Western Hemisphere, and with least cargo security incidents in the region due to the short distance and the speed of movements due to 65+ years of experience moving high volumes of cargo with the shortest customs and government processes in the region for years, Panama is the best place for regional distribution and value-added services for Latin America but now with the very high probabilities that it could also become a manufacturing hub.</p>\n<p>Panama’s new government has adopted the right approach with a view to supporting the growth of Panama’s logistics hub as was stated by the Minister for Private Investment Jose Alejandro Rojas during his opening talk at the Panama Supply Chain Forum. There are still tasks to accomplish the vision but a strong alliance between the public and private sectors as well as the inclusion of forward-looking multinationals who are streamlining their distribution and manufacturing regional hubs will be the key to realizing the vision in these turbulent times.</p>\n<p><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1846 alignleft\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Demo-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Demo-300x300.jpg 300w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Demo-100x100.jpg 100w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Demo-150x150.jpg 150w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Demo.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><b>Demostenes Perez Castillero, </b><b>General Manager </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Demostenes (Demo) Perez is the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">General Manager </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and a member of the company’s board of directors since 2005.

    "web_content": "<p>In business, SWOT analyses are used for organizations to assess strengths and weaknesses, usually to evaluate their position in the marketplace: <i>“What is our advantage if you compare us to X company? Where do they shine while we might struggle? Do we view anything as an immediate threat or opportunity?”</i> While valuable, this technique can drive retailers to focus only on immediately observable and comparative differences, rather than looking to the ‘bigger-picture’ challenges they face – a prime example of which is the need to optimize today’s supply chain.</p>\n<p><b>A firm foundation from which to execute is key</b></p>\n<p>Consider homeowners evaluating their houses for the market. One of the key value drivers for homes is how well they are built and equipped to stand the test of time. If a house is built on a hastily-made foundation, or one laid long ago that has begun to settle, the time and resources needed to fix it could add up to staggering debt.  Similarly, for retailers striving to eliminate their technological debt, as “cracks” start to appear in the supply chain ecosystem they’ve built, it becomes more obvious the foundation needs some work. In putting off the necessary “work,” investing in piecemeal technology or, worse, being slow to adopt it, retailers find they’re spending more in the long run than if they’d invested in a future-proof system at the start.</p>\n<p><b>The only effective way to combat disruption is by synchronizing supply chain activities onto one common platform</b></p>\n<p>Retailers are challenged by massive data, a great deal of inefficiencies, and unfortunate gaps in their true understanding of the consumer. Technology should meet these challenges and enable speed and agility, especially in the supply chain. But, investing for the sake of shiny, new tools isn’t the answer if you don’t have a good strategy to begin with, and many supply chains stand on a makeshift foundation of disconnected or loosely connected solutions. Further, retailers make investments and replace technology with swift decisions, rather than looking at the whole picture. Or, they customize their legacy technology in silos, only to realize after these time-consuming projects that they now have multiple systems that address the same business process. If retailers are struggling to execute because they are faced with too many decisions, or they continually run up against forecast errors and out-of-stocks, the focus to prioritize, then, is aligning all supply chain processes on one singular platform to harmonize demand forecasting, replenishment, allocation and order fulfilment. However, only 36% of supply chain professionals say their organization operates on a single supply chain platform.</p>\n<p><b>Rather than being frozen in time, retailers need to adopt a modernized approach</b></p>\n<p>As retailers strive to protect and grow margins, inventory is a key lever to pull in managing the high cost to serve, bringing us to one of the most crucial areas of supply chain: replenishment planning and execution. Your demand forecast fuels the supply chain and, without a foundation to connect supply chain activities, you’re not going to replenish and execute well.</p>\n<p>You don’t have to dig too deeply to see the disconnects become apparent:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>“Anyone’s guess” levels of inventory</b>: Retailers lack complete visibility into what’s available due to solutions that aren’t connected to the end-to-end supply chain. It’s tricky to replenish well when the status of inventory is a guessing game.</li>\n<li><b>Failing to appreciate new variables for the demand forecast</b>: Retailers can’t keep up with the volume and sources of data needed for forecast accuracy and customer behavior, especially for fresh items, is not as predictable as it used to be.</li>\n<li><b>Lack of a holistic approach to take in data:</b> MDM systems aren’t one-size-fits-all. The solution must be designed to understand custom lines of business for the retail industry, especially when it comes to short life and perishable items.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These and other issues mean that retailers struggle with manual intervention and human errors, understanding of actionable insights and how to effectively and quickly deliver results for their business units, as well as appreciation of how one impacts the other for a closed loop of intelligence. Retail winners are unafraid of innovation – they welcome new technology and are actively looking for ways to invest. Just look at Amazon, or to Walmart’s impressive work keeping up through innovation and acquisition. Also, AI cannot be ignored as it becomes more pervasive in the industry. In a recent survey, retailers expressed their belief that AI’s greatest potential to improve supply chain management relates to quality and speed. Fifty-nine percent cited real-time supply chain updates or quality control as the processes most likely to be impacted by the integration of AI, followed by improved demand management (49%) and the ability to identify and address inefficiencies (44%).2</p>\n<p><b>Data sources are complex. The system used to make sense of them shouldn’t be. </b></p>\n<p>Retailers are challenged to fully understand data and demand. Some of this is due to the sheer volume of data, but also because consumer behavior is unpredictable. As a result, legacy systems can’t keep pace with the current retail nuances. With a piecemeal supply chain, one function or another will always be lagging, operating separately and “in the dark.”.  Because traditional demand forecasting systems base predictions solely on historical data; they can’t measure external influence or keep up with changing customer behavior. And, since they lack the ability to learn, legacy solutions simply cannot forecast future demand. AI, however, does learn and delivers rich customer insights, based on complex data sources. When the AI engine learns and adapts to provide a different output according to its knowledge and understanding of all factors, tt gets smarter, sees things the human eye cannot, and delivers actionable insights supply chain leaders can use immediately. And because everything is self-contracted to evolve, AI eliminates the need for upgrades to supply chain systems, especially if delivered through a SaaS-based solution. Tied to AI, a cloud-delivered tool delivers the speed of change needed to keep up – and retailers gain autonomy.</p>\n<p><b>Future-proof your supply chain by leveraging proven AI-enabled supply chain applications delivered one platform for end-to-end visibility.</b></p>\n<p>A “future-proof” supply chain is one that can learn and predict customer demand by category, product, and channel. It’s connected, cohesive and autonomous. It’s an AI-powered supply chain operating on a single, unified platform in which each link supports and strengthens the others. It will streamline and automate the decision-making process to better support replenishment planning strategies, automating the decision-making process, minimizing errors, reducing cost and speeding up time-to-shelf. You’ll not only improve your total cost of ownership; you’ll also have a holistic understanding of your customer with a quick path to shopper satisfaction. By accurately predicting demand across all channels and applying analytics to historical and real-time data, you’ll have the ability to drive the entire supply chain. And you’ll gain what really matters in the end: a return on your technology investment, and a firm foundation to stand on.</p>\n<p><strong><span data-originalfontsize=\"10pt\" data-originalcomputedfontsize=\"13.333333015441895\">For more information, read the report referenced in this article.</span></strong></p>\n<p data-removefontsize=\"true\" data-originalcomputedfontsize=\"16\">With this link: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2Z5RZNv\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://bit.ly/2Z5RZNv&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1563987939648000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHT2hMr9K2qB923qy1yragd3MhsAw\" data-removefontsize=\"true\" data-originalcomputedfontsize=\"16\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">http://bit.ly/2Z5RZNv</a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>About The Author:</strong></span></p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1692\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Symphony-Retail-Logo-Colour-300x80.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"80\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Symphony-Retail-Logo-Colour-300x80.png 300w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Symphony-Retail-Logo-Colour-600x159.png 600w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Symphony-Retail-Logo-Colour-1024x272.png 1024w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Symphony-Retail-Logo-Colour-768x204.png 768w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Symphony-Retail-Logo-Colour-1536x408.png 1536w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Symphony-Retail-Logo-Colour-2048x544.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></p>\n<p><b>Symphony RetailAI has 25 years of experience in CPG retail </b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>15 of the top 25 Retailers are our customers</li>\n<li>25 of the top 25 CPGs are our customers</li>\n<li>Global operations with customers in 70 countries</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Role-based solutions for Retail and CPG </b></p>\n<p><b>Retail AI platform for customer-centric retailing </b></p>\n<p>For more information please visit them: <a href=\"https://www.symphonyretailai.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.symphonyretailai.com/</a></p>\n",

That’s why every month we highlight a woman leader in the industry on our blog. We share the stories, achievements, and advice for other women coming up the ranks in supply chain.</p>\n<p>This month we’re proud to feature <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessica-vania-lscm/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jessica Vania</a> in our Women In Supply Chain™ blog series. Jessica discovered Let’s Talk Supply Chain as a student. She is now a business operations analyst in Singapore for global Information Technology giant, HP. Jessica is an up-and-comer in the industry and a recent graduate in Logistics and Supply Chain Management.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What made you pursue a degree in supply chain management?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I’ve always been a dreamer. I always wanted to be creative—whether through illustration, as an architect, or a film editor. But Indonesia doesn&#8217;t have a lot of opportunities compared to America. So I did what my parents wanted me to do, got a diploma in accounting with the exception that I could pursue it abroad. But I wasn&#8217;t doing it for me and I wasn&#8217;t doing what I wanted to do.</p>\n<p>So that&#8217;s when I took every single booklet of every single major my university offered, flipped through every single page and happened upon logistics and supply chain. I interviewed some of the seniors and figured it might be a subject I could enjoy. It was a big decision for me to actually sign up and go to the classes. I told myself that there&#8217;s no going back. I&#8217;m going to take full responsibility for my decision. Fortunately the more I learned, the more interesting and exciting it became. I felt so at home, like I made the right decision.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>What made supply chain feel so right?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When you compare it to majors, like finance and economics, supply chain isn&#8217;t as much of the business side. It has some business, but also a bit of a technical side. Plus, you get to be creative. In one of my modules, we designed a warehouse based on a real company that we had to research. We made some assumptions, but it was a mix of real world and being creative. Finding Solutions and being practical helped me to combine my love of business, tech and creativity.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Speaking of being a dreamer, where do you see the chain taking you?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In the short-term, I want to be an awesome planner (my current position). For the long term, I&#8217;m looking to go into sustainability. I want to bring value in supply chains by looking at sustainable options that might not be considered. Being environmentally and socially responsible doesn’t mean a company needs to give up on economic profit. Being creative, I can incorporate sustainability by design. Whether that’s through the supply chain design or product design—seeking new sustainable materials options.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>What factors are you looking for in a business you want to work for?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In Singapore right now, there are a lot of management training positions. Almost like a glorified internship—companies are following the trend to attract new talent, but they don&#8217;t have a solid scheme that would benefit both the company and the person they are hiring. Because I am a foreigner here in Singapore, there are a lot of quotas and regulations that make the job search difficult and because of that, the size of the company is a default factor for me—leaving me open to multinational companies. I would look into company culture, career progression and the possibility of transfer or relocation. I remember asking about the possibility of switching departments or later relocating to another country, or even the possibility of business travel in interviews and getting a negative response. So I&#8217;m fortunate that I’m at HP where learning new things and taking new steps in your career is embraced. Every two years you’re allowed to move departments if there&#8217;s an opening. I&#8217;m lucky that the organization I work for ticks all the boxes above.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>How can more supply chain companies attract your generation and appeal to their values and cultural differences?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There’s a saying in Indonesia: “<em>Tak kenal maka tak saying</em>,” or “you can&#8217;t love what you don&#8217;t know”. We really need to expose more people to logistics and supply chain, so they can know more about it and see where they could add value. There are a lot of preconceived ideas and the industry is misunderstood. People think it is stuck in the traditional—all manual labor—and that the environment is dirty. For me, it&#8217;s more of like a backbone of the company’s operations. Once you invest and support the supply chain department, you get a return on investment very quickly. Even though it&#8217;s a back-end role, the younger generation should know that you have influence and you can contribute a lot, (even though you might not be seen doing it).</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>What needs to change in supply chain?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We need more female role models in the industry, especially in Asia. What [Sarah Barnes] has done [with Let’s Talk Supply Chain] has really opened up access to the industry. Especially with the Women In Supply Chain™ podcast and blog and The Trade Squad video series. This gives more exposure to people behind the supply chain industry. Three years ago, I didn&#8217;t even know about logistics and supply chain. And when I searched on the topic, there weren’t many people who talked about their experience in the industry itself. I would also love to see more ethical and sustainable supply chains focused on the circular economy. Like H&amp;M recently opening their first Garment recycling facility—they basically take up used clothing, sanitize it, re-use the cotton and create new garments all inside one container-sized facility inside the H&amp;M store itself. Lastly, I&#8217;d love to see companies focus more on utility than on profit. It might be a little far-fetched, but one of my favorite quotes from <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/esther-ndichu-59a8116?originalSubdomain=ae\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Esther Ndichu</a>, the Humanitarian Supply Chain director at UPS is “Hunger is not a food issue. It&#8217;s a logistics issue”.</p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>What advice can you give to others wanting to study supply chain?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Ask yourself two questions: First, is this really the industry or job you want? And second, what&#8217;s your passion that will keep you going when you don&#8217;t want to do it anymore? Do a lot research and some soul searching. Find somewhere in the supply chain where you can incorporate your vision and passion. Then try to link the two and pursue it, that can be your niche.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

    "web_content": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blockchain and AI in the supply chain</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technology is changing the world, and if you are not involved in it, then you are not going anywhere, as explained this year at Collision 2019. And there has never been a technology that has captured everyone&#8217;s attention like blockchain.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And that is why the procurement and supply chain industry has no option but to take up the challenge. For long, the industry has been languishing for lack of transformation. A modern chief procurement officer&#8217;s job seems to be focused on adopting new methods to meet the needs of users. The future appears to be holding for those without proper insight into technology.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So how will the industry survive in the future? What will it take for everyone in the industry to understand technology is the future of procurement? Let&#8217;s find out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is the roadmap of the profession?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Procurement organizations look more or less like white-collar jobs of the 1970s. There is too much manual process in the industry. Most key players in the industry still rely on manual ways of doing things.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though automation is transforming the business models, there are still so many things that are yet to be done. In simple terms, procurement officers need to work harder towards embracing technology. Some of the issues that still come up when things don&#8217;t work according to plan include lousy user experiences, incomplete functionalities, and missing on advanced features.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So what does an effective, responsive system look like?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have all shopped or have seen someone shop on Amazon, Alibaba, and other e-commerce stores. These services offer a great selection of products. You can compare items based on specification, price, shipping options, warranties, and customers support, among other features.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a buyer, there nothing better than having the power to compare different items according to needs, And to make things better, it is easy to receive the products within the shortest time possible.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet there are still users who have to go through the struggles of dealing with poorly designed systems. They are forced to accept poor decisions made on their behalf with these systems.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is sad to imagine that even after two decades of technological deployment, there is still a great struggle in most organizations. Most of them cannot get a comprehensive view of how they spend and how much time is used.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many cannot still get past the time-consuming routines, hard transaction activities, pricing, awards for contracts, and monitoring supplier performance. All these activities are still being done by procurement workers who take a long time putting the pieces together.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But if technology were applied, it would take only a few seconds for everything to be compiled. It is only when the right tech is put into action that we can get results.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The case with ERP</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ERP applications seemed to be the best option for a lot of companies. However, they turned out to be nothing but a complete failure. The process has, on many occasions, proven to be a stumbling block to excellence. They don&#8217;t help in the progression of the industry based on user needs. Instead, systems like Ariba and Coupa have only caused significant failure.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They are loathed by procurement users more than they are hated by business users. These systems are still rigid and hard to understand as most businesses still struggle to understand their expenditure.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Supply chain management can now enjoy linking and combining cross-functional data from outsourced and internal sources. They were to uncover where problems originate from. ERP was supposed to be the technology that transformed the procurement industry.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But this promised that included creating a flawless system failed to deliver. The main reason for this could be that there is too little time for growth and coming up with innovative ideas.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today…</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The landscape in the procurement industry is based on two parallel processes. On one side is sourcing activities and on the other is procure-to-pay. The processes are wrapped by analytics and governance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the complexities in day-to-day procurement seem to be getting bigger. The great suite migration of 2008-2010, for instance, left many small companies struggling in under giant players. They remained to experience minimal market share and limited influence.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since then, enterprises have had to pay for expensive systems hoping they would change something – they don&#8217;t. And we cannot blame tech vendors for this since most have entirely ignored the phenomenon.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In essence, supply chain and procurement are on the verge of extinction. The technologies meant to handle everything have become a means of destruction.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to undo it</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trying to turn a blind eye on AI, RPA, Blockchain, 3D printing, and similar techs will make things even worse. There are a few procurement processes that are already automated.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI, Blockchain, and Internet of Things have completely revolutionized user experience. The way people interact with technology is no longer a problem.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The simple truth is the digital revolution in supply chain management is the way to the future. Companies like Amazon have already digitalized procurement. Now all that remains is for companies to get into the system and adopt new ideas coming up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is no secret that procurement organizations have an essential role to play. And anyone can start using blockchain technology by first adopting related technologies. When automation came, IT was not disrupted, and blockchain is not going to disrupt procurement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get automated systems into place, and you are good to go. It does not take out human involvement but only makes it better simplifying tasks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Modern IT systems are self-managing, diagnosing, and repairing. That means you have a chance to make your processes more manageable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is it essential to act now?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the changing world of technology, there is every need for procurement managers to adopt new systems. If you don&#8217;t take action now, here are some of the things you will be missing on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ø  Complete automation. Blockchain locks information making repetitive actions possible.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ø  Clean data. With error-free data, you keep all parties informed. This means excellent collaboration throughout.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ø  Increased labor management through performance measurement of activities. You can keep records and project performance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ø  And increase in contractual obligation adherence. Each party involved understands their obligations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ø  Reduced counterfeit products. This is the greatest threat to modern businesses. Blockchain can identify the history of a product.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ø  Easy claims settlements and</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ø  Reduced costs of compliance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are the first steps?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understand that the supply chain is an integral part of a company&#8217;s operations. This is why the part forward starts from a paper road map. Managers must make the right decisions through real-time decisions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start by understanding the impact of digital transformation on the supply chain. The traditional method of doing things will be completely disrupted.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You don&#8217;t have to get rid of traditional systems such as procure-to-pay. They lay the architecture through a more flexible ecosystem hence making the field even.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every company needs a digital foundation. They can then capture, analyze, access with ease, and interpret information. The basics involve robotics and AI, which digitalize simple tasks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Driving the digital transformation by using cryptocurrency</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blockchain technology has revolutionized the way many companies operate. It is the future of business, and the supply chain and procurement managers need to adopt it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using cryptocurrency makes payments more straightforward and faster. This new currency seems to be gaining a lot of popularity. With so many talking about it, it is only a matter of time before it is fully recognized as a global currency.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No third party in the transactions means less fee and better service delivery. There is no blockchain without mentioning cryptocurrency.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We can succeed together or fail separately as summarized by Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada at Collision 2019.</span></p>\n<p>About The Author:<img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1512 alignleft\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image002-169x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"169\" height=\"300\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image002-169x300.jpg 169w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image002.jpg 487w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Charlotte de Brabandt, Institute for Supply Management<sup>®</sup>’s (ISM<sup>®</sup>) 30 Under 30 Rising Supply Chain Stars 2017 Megawatt Star and member of ISM’s Thought Leadership Council.Charlotte de Brabandt is a Technology and Negotiation Keynote Speaker &amp; Host with ample global industry experience in the field of automotive, timepieces, technology, pharma, consumer goods and medical devices.

    "web_content": "<p>Are organizations moving closer to the lights out supply chain? Not all- most organizations have learned that keeping a close pulse on their customer’s market trends and utilizing this valuable information to make supply chain decisions can improve the brand growth and ROI. There are certainly technology solutions aiming for a lights out outcome, and market leaders, like Amazon, increasingly investing in automation and testing new solutions; however even from Amazon the prospect of a lights out fulfillment network in <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/fully-automated-warehouses-are-a-decade-away-amazon-sa-1834459784\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">decades away.</a></p>\n<p>Supply chain is the new competitive weapon of the business. As consumer closely scrutinize every business decision of their favorite brands, the supply chain ability to be accurate, timely and deliver goods as promised has become more important than ever. Progressive organizations are leveraging their supply chain and creating competitive advantage by building stronger partnerships with their main suppliers, diving deep into last mile delivery solutions, and incorporating the voice of the customer in forecasting and supply planning.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Build Strong Partnerships with Key Suppliers</b></li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Companies cannot guarantee the integrity of their supply chain or quality of their product being far removed from sourcing and manufacturing processes. The growing expectation of accountability from consumers is pushing companies to become more engaged within their supply chain, build closer relationships with original equipment manufacturers and raw materials providers. Millennials prefer to make procurement deals directly with manufacturers- cutting out distributors. This process helps ensure tight quality controls, improve direct from factory cost savings; it also impacts margins and health of distributors who have thrived in this space. A <a href=\"https://pressroom.ups.com/pressroom/ContentDetailsViewer.page?ConceptType=PressReleases&amp;id=1560169134669-217\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">research study conducted by UPS</a> shows that millennials prefer researching companies online using tech channels that may be less familiar to older buyers. This trend has seen a 20% increase in the past two years and is expected to continue growing over the next 3-5 years, potentially eliminating a percentage of middle market distributors.</p>\n<p><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1505 alignleft\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/blog-picture-July-4-300x186.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"186\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/blog-picture-July-4-300x186.png 300w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/blog-picture-July-4-600x371.png 600w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/blog-picture-July-4-768x475.png 768w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/blog-picture-July-4.png 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" />As companies shape stronger partnerships in their supply chain and become more informed about their provider’s operations, new opportunities for data sharing, process improvement and collective costs savings will emerge. Currently, supply chain professionals struggle with the types and integrity of data available within and outside of the enterprise. Lack of accurate data sharing and collaborative analysis causes demand forecasting, supply and inventory bullwhip problems.  Accurately predicting and communicating demand trends across the entire supply chain will help businesses negotiate year-over-year price reductions in the order of 3%-5%. These are a direct result of setting shared goals with suppliers’ brands trust over time.</p>\n<p>Successful organizations need to be connected to their partners to ensure real time sensing of risk, changes in demand, or updates to orders. In supply chain, as in business at large, success is 100% dependent on strong partnerships, the sustained consolidation of the marine shipping industry over the past five years is a clear indication that together we are stronger.  Will we start to notice more vertical integration of organizations across varying industries?</p>\n<p><b>        2. Dive Deep into The Last Mile</b></p>\n<p>This is the #1 opportunity for the supply chain to interact with the customer, and oftentimes one of the most impactful times in the customer delight process of any purchase. The last mile offers unique opportunities for optimization, and cost savings with a focus on guaranteeing customer happiness and brand loyalty. Many traditional, and online only retailers focus on improving the last mile service with real time order updates, which include reverse logistics, and sometimes even. Consumers expect products to arrive on time and not damaged, with continuous visibility into the delivery status. Some organizations, such as Amazon have gone so far as to ensure the package is pleasant for the consumer to open, while maintaining packaging costs low with their SIOC (ship in own container) program.</p>\n<p>Over the past few years, as ecommerce growth has increased, leading companies invested pointedly into research and development for autonomous vehicles to help last mile delivery processes. Other service providers are expanding partnerships outside of the traditional shipping industry to continue improving services and transit times to consumes. For example, FedEx is increasing its partnership with Dollar General (8,000 locations) and Walmart (500 locations); the company is also investing in additional store fronts to continue servicing their most important customer sector, ecommerce SMBs. According to <a href=\"https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/fedex-office-retail-footprint-dollar-general/557717/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">FedEx</a> CMO “the FedEx Office retail locations bring in some of our most profitable small and medium business because [of] the experience they get when they are shipping&#8230;and they want the peace of mind of proper packaging.” This illustrates an understanding FedEx of just how important success in the last mile is for all involved.</p>\n<p>Last mile delivery is most impactful for the food industry, there are numerous opportunities to learn from innovations in this space. Whether prepared or online grocery, organizations providing these services to consumers must be even more vigilant of last mile services.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>      3. Listen to the Voice of the Customer</b></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Traditional supply chain solutions were designed to solve problems within the walls of the organization. Globalization forces all businesses, including SMLBs to think globally. Most realize that success with continued growth fully depends on outside factors, some out of our immediate control but some which can be influenced. Analyzing existing or historical data only teams do not get full visibility of their customer trends. This approach delivers sub-optimal supply and demand forecasting models and leads to making decisions on based fragmented information.</p>\n<p>Supply chain teams require real time point of sale data, consumer online sentiment, alongside partner driven forecast to assemble the monthly demand and supply planning. To successfully utilize the information organizations must diagnose customer behavior to prescribe the right market segmentation. Customers are getting closer to the supply chain- this is especially noticeable for higher end brands and items, where customers have immediate and direct impact on the well being of the organization, but this is increasingly truer even in highly commoditized consumer goods organizations.</p>\n<p>Tracking the brand, the consumers who interact with it, and translating this data into intelligent information that can help drive precise winning decisions. Supply chain needs to work with the data and truly know the customer. Who drives the business? E-commerce companies such as Amazon have huge amounts of customer data that can be used to target specific people and convince them to buy certain things. With mobile apps and loyalty programs, chains such as McDonald&#8217;s, Burger King, and Starbucks are attempting to similarly track customers, adjusting options to convince them to spend more. Supply chain teams need to be in the know of all these push/ pull strategies and collaborate cross-functionally to truly understand consumer trends.</p>\n<p>So, are we heading towards an era of lights-out supply chain management? No! Supply chains, as most consumer dependent businesses, rely on <b>people </b>to run them successfully. People to build the right supplier partnerships, people who can strengthen the connection between a brand and customer when the product is delivered, and people who can reach into the hearts of  consumers and understand what drives them.</p>\n",

    "web_content": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">World commerce is under continuous disruptions, the growing urgency in the arrival of a product or service expected by the consumer is not a trend anymore, supply chains are being transformed into digital supply chains or fulfillment networks as some experts like to refer to it these days. This new reality brings new challenges for every supply chain team worldwide.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How companies and their supply chain teams react to this market-consumer disruption will be the key to success or their path to failure.  As Eric Pearson CIO, IHG Group said, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">¨it´s no longer the big beating the small, but the fast beating the slow¨</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> these days it applies in almost all business and this is why: who puts the product first on the hands of the customer in an efficient and safe way will be the winner in this race. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Latin America the ¨Amazon effect¨ is probably less felt than in other markets due the distribution challenges in the region but the consumers are getting the same information everywhere. Realtime information about new products, fashion, trends, events and services are as close as their smartphone regardless the time and place. This is when supply chain challenges begin, the need to fulfill a customer’s whim because of what she saw on an Instagram post or any other social network are creating headaches to many of us.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Latin America and the Caribbean represent over 30 countries that span the extremes of Brazil with 210 millions of population to small rocks in the Windward Islands like St Vincent with 110,000 population additionally you have to deal with the complexity of deal domestic government rules and regulations, languages and cultures. Is common to hear  ¨We are not interested in serving  X, Y, or Z  market because is so complex and the volumes are low we will only focus on the bigger and easiest markets¨ let´s give that market to a distributor who take care of it,  however,  in today’s competitive business environment the correct statement should be  ¨How we can reach the customers in that range of countries so we can satisfy their demand as well as increase our market share and brand recognition with all our assortment of products? ¨ the answer to that question is with no doubt: Panama. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Panama is the by any measure the best location for a multimodal logistics operation. The country boasts a first-class infrastructure as well as outstanding logistics assets that make it the center for the distribution, order fulfillment, light assembly, storage, manufacturing, heavy or light assembly distribution, spare parts logistics, e commerce, reverse logistics, cold chain management as well as any manner value added requirements of any product required for distribution on the entire region. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><b>Connectivity, Connectivity, Connectivity</b><b> </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The old saying real state is    ¨Location, Location, Location¨ but in the supply chain world, location without connectivity, reliability and a broad portfolio of services and interoperability is a little value.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Panama is strategically located in the center of the Americas and from the early years of the sixteen century the Spanish conquistadores used Panama for bringing finished goods to the city of Portobello in the Caribbean side of Panama and returning with the new world treasures after being trade in the Portobello fairs.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having the newly expanded Panama Canal as the transportation backbone that moves the 8% of the world’s commerce that reaches a market of 1.3 billion consumers, it’s an extremely valuable asset. Panama is number one in Latin America and the Caribbean in the Liner Shipping Connectivity Index (LSCI) On average, 55 regular line services dock in Panama´s 6 ports every week, connecting directly with 148 ports in more than 50 countries in the world. While the Atlantic port conglomerate is also number one ranking of container port throughput and the Pacific ports number two effectively having ports on both oceans makes the country ranks 6th in the world in regard to port infrastructure.  Dr. Don Rattlif Regents&#8217; Professor Emeritus in Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering at Georgia Tech and Co-Executive Director of the Georgia Tech Panama Logistics Innovation &amp; Research Center.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">said, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">¨Panama is unique: it is a port with terminals in two oceans¨,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the distance from ocean to ocean is less than 50 miles. The country has also the best-connected airport in Latin America and offers unsurpassed advantages, more than 132,000 annual direct flights departing from Tocumen International Airport to 90 destinations in 35 countries, including 16 cities in Canada and the United States and connecting key European destinations such as China, Germany, Spain, France, Italy and the Netherlands. A new end of the runway logistics complex is now under construction at the Tocumen cargo terminal that will add a new platform to expand the range of services offered in Panama, this project is mainly focused on e commerce, spare parts logistics and pharma companies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the objective of increasing foreign investment and consolidating the logistics and services platform of Panama</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> created the “SEM” regime and over 145 multinational companies are taking advantage </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of the law that encourages a wide range of activities and benefits to drive the growth of multinational companies in Latin America, enabling them to reduce operational costs and maximize their efficiency</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  companies such as Pfizer, Adidas, Samsung, Dell, Sony, Under Armour, Bayer, 3M, Diageo, Phillips, HP, Payless Shoes, Huawei among others are enjoying the benefits on this special regime. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The international companies that develop logistics operations in Panama, also take advantage of the tax, labor and migratory benefits that the country offers as incentive for foreign investment. These companies are exempt from income tax on their foreign and domestic operations, as well as from other taxes and import duties. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Panama is also a strategic point for global logistics companies, such as DHL, Ceva, Expeditors, Damco, DB Schenker, K&amp;N, Panalpina and recently DSV and Nippon Express opened branches. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During my experience working with global companies helping them to develop their Latam business strategies through efficient logistics  operations, obtaining a differentiator factor on the market by service innovation, liberating cash flow, offering a shortest time to customer,  reducing inventory carrying costs and risk, we have developed logistics operations and platforms for a very wide range of services and industries from:  Emergency small spare parts solutions to underground mining drilling equipment and everything in between. (Engineering, fashion apparel, Pharma, Wine and spirits, Telecom, Automotive, consumer electronics, heavy equipment, e commerce, Hi Tech, CPG companies among others) </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2017 Panama started a procs to established diplomatic relations with The People&#8217;s Republic of China, these days both countries are working on a Free Trade Agreement, that also led to the historic visit to Panama of President Xi Jinping. We learn about the Panama’s key role in China’s silk roads. Eddie Tapiero Competitive Intelligence Specialist at Panama Canal Authority during his book (The silk road and Panama)  presentation said: this initiatives not only has a direct impact on the commercial and investment field of the Isthmus but also incorporate Panama into the Chinese initiative</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">‘One Belt, One Road’ (OBOR), also known as the new ‘Silk Road’, “Once the construction of the infrastructure planned for these routes (new ports, railways and free zones) is completed, Europe will not only be consumers of the products coming from China but will become a center for the collection and distribution of commodities.  Because of its access to the Atlantic, Panama could take advantage of that trade, but, Panama can also take advantage of the Pacific side, to materialize its entry to the Pacific Alliance,” The Silk Road and its impact on trade in Asia and Europe should not be left aside, instead should review long-term state strategies, so that economies, both China and Panama, continue to strengthen. The reality is that commercial and cultural exchange started approximately by1854 when the first important group of Chinese citizens arrived in Panama to work on the construction of the first transcontinental railroad so the history between both countries has over 150 years.  </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The uncertainty created by the US-China trade war is leading American retailers to make changes in their import strategies for goods from Asia&#8217;s largest economy to avoid new tariffs and ensure they have adequate supplies to keep their business going on but what about those companies that are importing to the US from China and after will be shipping goods to Latin America?  Their goods will be more expensive and will automatically lose customers and market share by their competitors that are reaching this market in a more agile way, the obvious solution for companies who want to reach the Latin American market in a faster, safer and reliable way the only competitive option is: </span><b>Panama</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the Latin American logistics capital.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The author is a Supply Chain business strategist at LSP Group, former President of the Panama Logistics Council and President of CSCMP Panama Roundtable.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n",

Team chemistry is one of the most complicated keys to the success of organizations. Effective teams are more than just a collection of talented members. To be effective, a team has to be able to combine the efforts and abilities of members in the right way. I wouldn’t be that bold with your statement. Its too concrete. I would leave it at, “Team chemistry is just as important to building a successful office as hiring talented individuals.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone knows the importance of having a job that you enjoy, but even your dream job can turn into a nightmare if you aren’t surrounded by the right people. This is why managers need to focus on team chemistry to create a work environment where their employees grow together as both coworkers and have a professional level of friendship so they look forward to each day rather than dreading getting out of bed. Feeling like you work with friends makes going to work every day much easier. Chemistry makes workplace teams more effective. The benefits of having good chemistry at the workplace include increased productivity and satisfaction in work teams. Chemistry maximizes team efforts –regardless of the apparent differences in skills, educational background, and personalities. Chemistry is a vital part of any relationship, and can revolutionize a workplace.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you know that one of the biggest problems in the office can be office drama? There is far less drama when you like who you are working with and view them as not just coworkers, but as friends</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you work with coworkers you like, you tend to want to work harder for them. You don’t want to let someone down that you respect and have any level of friendship with</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When coworkers don’t respect and appreciate each other, they may avoid communication with each other, which means their work can suffer and that isn’t good for the business as a whole.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s just like dating the “perfect person”. Have you ever dated someone, who by definition should have been “perfect” for you but something always felt like it was missing? Other times, you instantly have a connection– almost as if you’ve known the person your entire life with people who are your complete opposite. If you were to describe that relationship, words like understanding, bond, and compatibility might come to mind. Your brain actually releases a chemical, dopamine, that reinforces those feelings and help to cement the relationship. This sense of familiarity and connection that took place in that relationship was experienced again in your friendships, and perhaps on athletic or workplace teams. The best term to describe this unexplainable bond between people is chemistry.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Webster’s Dictionary, chemistry is an interaction between people working together; specifically:  such interaction when harmonious or effective. The key words that accurately describe chemistry are “attraction” and “effective.” This special ingredient makes up a perfect and important component in the workplace. Without this harmonious or effective connection, it may be hard to produce meaningful and unbelievably good work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Good chemistry isn’t necessary in the workplace until your competition has it and you don’t. As Babe Ruth reportedly once said, &#8220;You may have the greatest bunch of individual stars in the world, but if they don&#8217;t play together, the club won&#8217;t be worth a dime.&#8221; Without good team chemistry, talented teams can find it tough to function well. With team chemistry, employers can focus on getting the most out of their team&#8217;s talent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When chemistry is not present, it can be difficult to develop an effective “talent attraction” or relationship with someone, especially a job candidate. During an interview, a candidate may have all the qualifications needed for an open position, but very little chemistry with the interviewer or the organization. Employers may be a little reluctant to hire candidates who do not bring that “special spark” to the interview process. Or, when chemistry is lacking, candidates might simply might be forgotten during the process. On the other hand, candidates with “the spark” are more likely to be remembered (and hired!) when narrowing down the talent pool.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Management expert Ken Blanchard suggests that teams fail roughly 60 percent of the time. While the reasons for team failure vary &#8212; such as lack of planning, focus, or resources &#8212; it&#8217;s rarely due to lack of talent. However, an effective team needs more than just a group of talented people. True team effectiveness requires team members to work well together regardless of their abilities. Here are five reasons why team chemistry is more important than talent alone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TEAM CHEMISTRY = COOPERATION No matter how talented people are, if they don&#8217;t work well together, they won&#8217;t accomplish much. Exceptional talent can carry a big ego. Sometimes sacrificing the talent can help you avoid power struggles and team fragmentation. On the other hand, when there is team chemistry, team members enjoy working together. Cooperation can lead to higher efficiency, faster results, and better outcomes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TEAM CHEMISTRY = PRODUCTIVITY Experts suggest that teams with good chemistry are more productive because they understand what each member brings to the team and work to maximize strengths and minimize weaknesses of the other team members. Additionally, they manage their time better. Without team chemistry, members can end up arguing over project details rather than working to find solutions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TEAM CHEMISTRY = GOOD ATTENDANCE In addition to physical ailments or family needs, some of the top reasons for absenteeism in the workplace include harassment, disengagement, stress, and low morale. Build a team with great chemistry and you reduce interpersonal conflicts. This, in turn, can reduce absenteeism and turnover.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TEAM CHEMISTRY = LOYALTY According to 2017 statistics from Gallup, over two-thirds of the American workforce is disengaged from their job (51% not engaged, 16% actively disengaged). This means that 67 percent of employees feel apathetic about their work. Since enthusiastic employees tend to be loyal employees, it&#8217;s important to engage team members. Engagement comes from having a great team environment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TEAM CHEMISTRY = SUCCESS Experts suggest that talent will only get a team so far. This is because team members who aren&#8217;t on the same page as the rest of the team or only focus on their own success can cause internal conflict. However, when there is team chemistry, individuals work together to advance the team&#8217;s goals leading to a higher chance of team success.</span></p>\n<p><strong>ABOUT THE AUTHOR:</strong></p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1146 alignright\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/HeadShot1-239x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"239\" height=\"300\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/HeadShot1-239x300.jpg 239w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/HeadShot1-600x754.jpg 600w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/HeadShot1-815x1024.jpg 815w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/HeadShot1-768x965.jpg 768w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/HeadShot1-1223x1536.jpg 1223w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/HeadShot1-1630x2048.jpg 1630w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/HeadShot1.jpg 1709w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 239px) 100vw, 239px\" />HEAR MORE FROM MICHELLE IN Women In Supply Chain™ PART 18 <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/sea-2-ep-62-women-in-supply-chain-part-18-michelle-devevo/\">HERE</a></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michelle DeVevo is Vice President of Talent Acquisition for one of the most successful third-party logistics providers, SunkteckttsNYC, with offices located in Acton, MA, Jacksonville, FL and New Jersey.A triple threat, Michelle DeVevo knows recruitment, culture and employer branding.

    "web_content": "<p>Amazon is fundamentally changing the way consumers and industry professionals think about retail and supply chain. And, if you’re reading this then you probably already realize that when it comes to supply chain and commerce – change is the only constant now. The industry is moving harder and faster to reach escalating customer demands fueled by the eCommerce giant and on demand technologies.</p>\n<p>So, how did we get here and how do we move forward?</p>\n<p>Supply chain’s digital age was started by advancements in technology and the generation that now occupies the largest consumer spending block: millennials. The consumer buyer’s cycle has become a blip and on demand services and mobile means businesses have a captive audience of shoppers all the time, everywhere and they want everything now.</p>\n<p>If it seems like your news and social feeds are saturated by the eCommerce leader and their every next move – that’s because they are. But by monitoring Amazon’s progress, retailers, manufacturers and logistics providers across the chain can see what’s next in digital and how to elevate their strategies.</p>\n<p>To make it convenient for you, here are the 3 latest Amazon moves you can’t miss and how you can respond:</p>\n<p>1. Prime members now get same-day and one-day deliveries in select areas.</p>\n<p>Think Uber, but for Amazon. Amazon has been building a national presence of distribution centers, backed by full-time drivers and the gig economy. Amazon Flex drivers <a href=\"https://flex.amazon.com/\" target=\"_top\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">make $18-25 hourly with the autonomy</a> of being their own bosses. If a driver is 21 or over and has a mid-sized sedan or truck and current driver’s license they are directed to the app and ready to go. These drivers give Amazon edge for last-mile deliveries to keep one-day and same-day deliveries on schedule.</p>\n<p><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright\" style=\"text-align: right;\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/LTSC-3-Amazon-Moves-You-Need-to-Know-About-Now-and-How-You-Can-Compete.jpg\" width=\"362\" height=\"241\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"></p>\n<p>While consumers are all in for quick deliveries, one <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GaleBonker/status/1122882620423954432\" target=\"_top\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">tweeted</a>, “Please stop,” linking an article on union’s raising concerns for warehouse workers. “Humanity doesn’t need this.” Speaking of humanity, last year Business Insider released a disturbing report on Amazon’s working conditions from the company’s drivers&#8217; first-hand, revealing the “true cost of free shipping”.</p>\n<p>While consumers are all in for quick deliveries, one tweeted, “Please stop,” linking an article on union’s raising concerns for warehouse workers. “Humanity doesn’t need this.” Speaking of humanity, last year Business Insider <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-delivery-drivers-reveal-claims-of-disturbing-work-conditions-2018-8\" target=\"_top\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">released a disturbing report</a> on Amazon’s working conditions from the company’s drivers&#8217; first-hand, revealing the “true cost of free shipping”.</p>\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\n<p>How can you compete? While our on demand economy mandates the right technologies, retailers and their partners across the supply chain need to think bigger than that. Some retailers are already offering in-store and curb-side pickup; why not add same-day deliveries to that list? While more retailers are already offering delivery, none are amassing the gig economy drivers the way Amazon is. Why not?</p>\n<p>Isn’t it time for retailers to take the same approach in building out an on demand fleet of flexible drivers? If your business isn’t talking about having a Chief on Demand Officer (CODO), you probably should—soon. There is no reason retail chains and logistics companies can’t build out a network of on demand drivers like Amazon has for local and last-mile, same and next-day deliveries. Or, look for ways to tap into partnerships with Lyft and Uber, companies known for their entrepreneurialism, growing partnerships and endless innovation.</p>\n<p>And why not be competitive with Amazon when it comes to getting truckers and warehouse workers and tap into social sentiment that’s reached the upper echelons of American democracy? There is a shortage of truckers and warehouse labor for retailers, 3PLS and logistics companies to hire – push the benefits of working for your business.</p>\n<p>Focus on the human element and the working conditions that align with your company’s values and their unions’. Partner with unions in getting your message out – Amazon isn’t just competing for shoppers they’re also competing for the workforce that make their service levels possible.</p>\n<p>And don’t stop there. <a href=\"https://nrf.com/blog/connecting-socially-aware-consumers\" target=\"_top\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">According to the National Retail Federation (NRF)</a> millennials want to shop from socially conscious brands that align with their values. In fact, the federation shared that around 60% of consumers would ditch their favorite brands if they realized the business’s values don’t align with their own. Make sure your brand is promoting in your marketing, on your website, social media and in the media how you value your employee experience as much as your customer experience – it matters.</p>\n<p>2. Some retailers are now taking Amazon returns.</p>\n<p>In fact, <a href=\"https://www.kohls.com/feature/amazon.jsp\" target=\"_top\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Kohl’s is now accepting and shipping</a> returns for shoppers for free. The move will bring the national retail chain more foot traffic and empower them to find opportunities to help shoppers find similar items right inside of their stores. While an interesting concept, it’s a double-edged sword.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft\" style=\"text-align: left;\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/LTSC-3-Amazon-Moves-You-Need-to-Know-About-Now-and-How-You-Can-Compete-2.png\" width=\"386\" height=\"255\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"></p>\n<p>How can you compete? Retailers can be focusing on making returns easier for their eCommerce purchases by ensuring all returns can be accepted right in the store. Retailers should be pushing this message out to the masses – if you don’t love it, bring it to your nearest location and exchange it for something you do or get your money back.</p>\n<p>Sound basic, maybe a little old school? Exactly. That’s because it is. While technology and convenience have been reshaping the industry landscape across the supply chain, there are some mainstays inherent to marketing that haven’t changed – creating a positive, personal customer experience. And sometimes driving to the closest store to exchange that jacket you need for tomorrow’s interview is a better option than free shipping back to Amazon, right? Exactly.</p>\n<p>3. Resellers are selling potentially defective Amazon returns.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kirimasters/2019/05/06/inside-the-world-of-liquidated-amazon-merchandise/#476da0ea7bf8\" target=\"_top\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Forbes recently shared on this phenomenon. Amazon sells some of this inventory to liquidation buyers by the pallet or truckload. Amazon offers free returns on these products marked as “defective,” so oftentimes consumers mark products as defective that are in working condition. The result? Resellers like Connelly list these former undesirables with sometimes zero refurbishing in “used” condition. </a></p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright\" style=\"text-align: right;\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/LTSC-3-Amazon-Moves-You-Need-to-Know-About-Now-and-How-You-Can-Compete-3.png\" width=\"378\" height=\"503\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"></p>\n<p>How can you compete? How are you repurposing or reselling returned items? Reselling may not always be the answer, but there is an option that Amazon doesn’t rely on frequently, evidenced by articles like the Rolling Stone’s titled: Jeff Bezos, Amazon: Why ‘Charity’ Is Wrong Solution.</p>\n<p>There has been a lot of dialogue buzzing online about the lack of philanthropy from the eCommerce leader. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/9/13/17855950/jeff-bezos-donation-2-billion-philanthropy-charity-amazon-ceo\" target=\"_top\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Vox</a> reported last fall that “scrutiny is not going to end for the world’s wealthiest person, who on Thursday announced he would dedicate at least $2 billion to philanthropic projects. It’s a long time coming for the Amazon CEO, who had yet to spend any real amount of his $163 billion in assets on charity, despite external pressure.”</p>\n<p>There has been a lot of dialogue buzzing online about the lack of philanthropy from the eCommerce leader. Vox reported last fall that “scrutiny is not going to end for the world’s wealthiest person, who on Thursday announced he would <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/1040253796293795842\" target=\"_top\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">dedicate at least $2 billion to philanthropic projects</a>. It’s a long time coming for the Amazon CEO, who had yet to spend any real amount of his $163 billion in assets on charity, despite external pressure.”</p>\n<p>Why not repurpose returns that can’t be marked down and are in working condition to give back to shelters and charities across the community? You’ll keep your margins tighter with tax deductions, but also you’ll also be giving back and keeping an active dialogue going around something that Amazon seems to miss – values and community.</p>\n<p>About The Author:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft\" style=\"text-align: left;\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/LTSC-3-Amazon-Moves-You-Need-to-Know-About-Now-and-How-You-Can-Compete-author.jpg\" width=\"292\" height=\"292\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"></p>\n<p>Naomi Garnice has 13 years of experience in telling brand stories and increasing online lead gen, and exposure and five years of experience managing and mentoring up-and-comers.

We all have busy in our lives and if we don&#8217;t take care of ourselves it can often leads to exhaustion and stress which are harmful to our minds, bodies, spirit and success.</p>\n<p>I thought I would share with you some of the ways I take a moment to &#8220;un-busy&#8221; and take the stress out of my life. I am not perfect and some days I need a real kick in the ass to put them into action but knowing they are tools in my toolbox brings a sigh of relief.</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol>\n<li>Box Breathing &#8211; Breathe in for a count of 4, hold your breath for a count of 4, exhale for a count of 4 and hold that for a count of 4. If you feel anxious before starting as you are doing the exercise, tell yourself that you are safe, in a safe place and nothing can harm you.</li>\n<li>Meditation &#8211; No its not just a fad, no you don&#8217;t have to sit cross legged, palms up and hum (you can if you want). Through meditation some people can bring their heart rate and their bodies to a calm state but everyone has their OWN experience. Some days I do a body scan to get started because I need a focus &#8211; I start at the top of my head and work my way down acknowledging every body part, some days it just takes breathing and going into a meditative state, some times I visualize what I want for my life but trust me it didn&#8217;t come easy. It took years of frustration, patience and a little help from an app called &#8220;headspace&#8221; but once I got it, I got it and it looks different every time. A similar type of meditation is called &#8220;tapping&#8221; that one I am still trying to wrap my head around, but one of these days it will be another tool in the <a style=\"border: none; color: #333; font-weight: normal !important; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://mexicaninsurance.com/mexico-car-auto-insurance-san-diego-mexican\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">mexicaninsurance.com</a> toolbox.</li>\n<li>Gratitude Journal &#8211; Lets face it, you cant stay in a negative space if you are grateful. Some do this first thing in the morning before they start work, they write down 10 things they are grateful for: my family, the breath I am taking this morning, opportunity, dogs, house (roof over my head) etc. Me? I like to do it before bed &#8211; 3 things I am grateful for that day, 3 things that brought me joy, 3 things that are positive about tomorrow and then sometimes I write my feelings in a feelings journal. (Ok that might feel a little weird for some but that is where I get out the negative and reflect on why I am feeling that way)</li>\n<li>Exercise! &#8211; Take a walk, go to the gym, play a sport, stretch, play with your kids &#8211; get out an do something physical, you will feel so much better. I could be having the worst day but when I put on the catcher&#8217;s equipment and get out on the ball field I feel instantly better.</li>\n<li>Do something you enjoy &#8211; Whatever that is, just make time for it, plan it into your day if you have to.</li>\n<li>Pets &#8211; If you have a pet or your friend has a pet, spread some love and spend sometime with them &#8211; playing with a toy, catching a cuddle or even having a one sided conversation with them</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Vacation &#8211; Virtual or reality &#8211; Take some time, you don&#8217;t have to go far or spend a lot of money but get out of your regular environment and explore.

They are short, to the point and give great bite size takeaways for everyone to turn into action right away. I have been having a lot of conversations around supply chain talent but not enough around interview etiquette, how someone walks into a room or presents themselves in the interview absolutely matters so that is why this particular advice resonated with me and I want to share with the community. Plus when we know better we do better, we change our lives and the journey that we are on and just simply because I think it’s better to win together and spread the knowledge as there might be one person out there who needs to hear it.</p>\n<p>Getting a job in any field is a challenge, but getting a job in supply chain is tough because everything is changing so fast and there is an art to giving a good interview. I recently read a post on Linkedin that asked why we make candidates jump through hoops and go above and beyond when we could just keep it simple. I think it’s on both parties to keep it mindful (unbiased), a meaningful experience and respectful so here are some of the tips Barbara shared on her <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ObiJKbg0jY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">episode </a></p>\n<p>Barbara says&#8230;..Presentation matters!</p>\n<p>#1 BE AWARE of posture when you walk in, this will determine whether you look secure and confident. Barbara says she eliminates 2 out of 3 candidates based on this one alone!</p>\n<p>#2 PRACTICE your handshake&#8230;make sure it is firm and make contact with the inner part of the thumb, push gently. Barbara says if you don&#8217;t do this that it means your untrustworthy &#8211; who knew!</p>\n<p>#3 ALWAYS look into the interviewers eyes because it creates trust &#8211; love this one and I have been practicing this for years, just try not to make it creepy!</p>\n<p>#4 DRESS IN YOUR SUNDAY BEST &#8211; Look respectable which means looking neat and well dressed without attracting attention. For women Barbara says NOT to wear 4in heels, you want to wear shoes that suggest you can work and you can’t work in 4in heels &#8211; #truth</p>\n",
