Hey Eddie, 3 important things for the Production:
1.	 The SSL certificate is causing issue, I think just like the first time it is incomplete. APIs are working fine. I can access http server internally, but https server internally throws error.
2.	User Permissions are not set for us, I can only see Manikâ€™s user permission. Unless we are given permissions we cannot test the final application.
3.	For the missing files permission, I need to manually set the metadata for those files, otherwise they will be re-ingested in the nightly cycle. Unless the permissions are set in the final deliverables list, I cannot proceed further.
