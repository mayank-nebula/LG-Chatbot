He has more than 30 years of leadership experience in the enterprise software, supply chain and retail industry. Duncan previously held senior executive roles at Infor, Oracle and Retek. While serving as President of Infor, an industry cloud applications company with more than 70,000 customers, he helped lead the transformation of the company into the first industry cloud company with over 60 million subscribers. This ultimately led to Infor’s successful sale to Koch Industries. Most recently, Duncan served as managing partner of Arcspring, a technology-focused private equity firm built by technology operators, which he co-founded. He also serves on the board of Honeywell. Duncan served as Chief Strategy Officer and President Retail.com at Retek. During his tenure with Retek, he was instrumental in growing the company from $13 million to nearly $175 million in revenue, which helped lead to a successful IPO and, ultimately, its sale to Oracle Corporation. Duncan holds a bachelor’s in Economics from University College London (UCL), University of London. He always strives to introduce diversity into business and is passionate about building organizations centered around comradery, passion, and purpose. An early crypto geek, he enjoys exploring how blockchain and web3 technologies like tokens, DeFi, DAOs, NFTs, AR/VR and the metaverse will change the world. Originally from the UK, Duncan grew up all over the world, including Singapore, Indonesia, Philippines, Hong Kong, Bahrain, Dubai, and Saudi Arabia, before returning to England. He has lived in Atlanta for almost 20 years with his wife, son, and daughter. He is passionate about water sports, especially wakeboarding and wakesurfing.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/V1LW0n5jwg0?si=JDY8RtqaNL_KMzYR\" width=\"640\" height=\"498\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>IN THIS EPISODE WE DISCUSS:</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>[03.52] An introduction to Duncan, his background and career journey, and what has always interested him about technology.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I’m lucky to have lived through multiple computing transitions, and I always loved the idea that you could leverage technology and code to solve problems.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[07.55] The biggest challenges and opportunities for 2026, and why businesses need to step back and look at the bigger picture.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Disruption and complexity is business as usual in supply chain… So we don’t get hung up on how you’re going to solve for tariffs. You need to have a systemic approach to being more agile, resilient and efficient <em>all the time</em>.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[12.54] From the importance of change management to putting a focus on building trust, how organizations are adjusting to a new reality of near-constant disruption and emerging technologies.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“There’s a lot of experimentation, but not a lot of companies have crossed the chasm from pilot and sexy demo into production… The consequences of getting something wrong have huge business implications.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[18.20] How businesses can actually prepare for disruption.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Fundamentally it’s about speed and precision, and having a business and software architecture that enables that. Supply chain, historically, doesn’t look like that.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[22.27] Blue Yonder’s long-term vision for transforming global supply chains, and how technology is shaping that future.</p>\n<p>[26.06] The biggest roadblocks right now with AI integration and adoption, and why supply chain sits in a unique position bridging the digital and physical worlds.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“The worst people to innovate in a category are experts.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[30.47] How businesses can get out of testing mode and lean into scalable innovation.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Helping people understand and manage their data is step one.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[32.59] How Blue Yonder has combined multiple types of AI to create new solutions for retailers, practical examples of that AI in action, and why complete automation is the ultimate end goal.</p>\n<p>[39.13] What truly sets an organization apart as innovative.</p>\n<p>[41.49] What leaders should be doing and thinking about now to position for the future.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>RESOURCES AND LINKS MENTIONED:</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Head over to Blue Yonder’s <a href=\"https://blueyonder.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">website</a> now to find out more and discover how they could help you too.
