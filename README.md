3. Different Ingestion Techniques for PPT, PPTX, DOC, DOCX, PDF
The ingestion process involves extracting content from PPT, PPTX, DOC, DOCX, and PDF files and storing the original data in a PKL file within in-memory storage. The original content, whether base64 encoded or OCR extracted, is processed to create summaries, which are then stored in a vector store. For PPT and PPTX files, slides are extracted as images and sent in their entirety for summarization, as individual elements of a slide are challenging to interpret in isolation. For DOC, DOCX, and PDF files, OCR is performed using models like FlorenceRCR, TesseractSB, or GPT-4(O), where the entire image is passed through the model to get OCR results. Tables are extracted as images and then summarized separately. Similarly, images are extracted using the unstructured library and summarized. This approach ensures that all relevant content—whether text, tables, or images—is accurately represented in the RAG system, with the original documents preserved in PKL format for retrieval and the summaries optimized for efficient search and retrieval in the vector store.

4. Ingestion for Summary
The summary creation process is designed to generate concise and coherent summaries by concatenating individual summaries from different content types within a document, such as text, tables, and images. Due to limitations in context window size, the system processes and summarizes up to 75 pieces of content at a time, after which these partial summaries are concatenated to form a comprehensive summary of the entire document. This summary is then stored in the vector store, allowing for efficient retrieval and answering of user queries related to the document's content. The original documents, stored in PKL format, remain available for reference, while the summaries enable quick access to the key points and overall context of each document.
