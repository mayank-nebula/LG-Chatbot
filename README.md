To understand any dependencies or impact on our side, it would help if we could get a bit more clarity from Sarah/Al on the following:

Timeline for Al’s work
How long is the category enhancement expected to take? Our category page development is tied to the final structure, so knowing his timeline will help us plan accordingly.

Details of what’s being changed
What exactly will Al be modifying in terms of the category schema, metadata, or taxonomy setup?
At the moment, we’re fetching categories and re-filtering on our side, so any structural changes on his end directly affect our integration.

Impact on APIs or data structure
Will the REST API responses or the way category–content relationships are stored change? This helps us avoid rework later when wiring up the frontend.

Expected performance/UX improvements
If Al’s changes streamline category associations, this could also help us — cleaner taxonomy often means less filtering on the frontend and faster response times. We’d like to understand if we can leverage the improvements as well.

Access to preview or sample output
If Al has a staging environment, sample JSON responses, or even a rough output of the new structure, sharing that would help us configure our Next.js queries correctly from the start.

Once we have these details, we’ll be able to align both streams of work and ensure everything fits together smoothly without any overlap.

Thanks,
