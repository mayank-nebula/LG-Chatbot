Hi Team,

I have created a folder named retriever in the LLM Machine(52.158.238.161) at the path /home/Mayank.Sharma/GV_Test/retriever.

To execute the Python file, follow these steps:
1. Activate the conda environment.
2. Navigate to the directory `/home/Mayank.Sharma/GV_Test/retriever`.
3. Install the dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

To get answers to your questions:
1. Place your question in a CSV file.
2. A new CSV file named `answer.csv` will be created with all the relevant information regarding your question.

Let me know if you need any more adjustments!
