Got it — you want the email to focus on two main points only:

1️⃣ Redis caching recommendation (vs API quota increase)
2️⃣ Missing/unknown-category pages (example.com/slug) that exist in backend but are not found in frontend categories, and you're unsure where they belong

Here is a clean, professional combined email with only those two points:

📧 Email Draft (Final Version — Two Main Points Only)

Subject: Recommendation on Caching Strategy and Clarification on Unmapped Pages

Hi [Name],

While working on the current website resampling, I encountered two important issues that need your guidance:

1. Recommendation: Implement Redis Caching Instead of Increasing API Quota

We recently exceeded the daily YouTube Data API v3 quota (10,000 units/day), which caused related features to stop functioning. To avoid this recurring issue, I evaluated the option of requesting a higher API quota versus implementing Redis caching.

After analysis, Redis caching is the more cost-efficient and scalable solution.

It drastically reduces YouTube API calls (from thousands/day to fewer than ~100/day)

Keeps us safely within the free quota limits

Improves page load speed under high footfall

Redis can also be reused as a shared caching layer for multiple other pages across the website, not only for YouTube data

Increasing the API quota would not only be uncertain (Google approval required) but could also lead to higher backend costs as traffic continues to grow.

Therefore, I recommend moving forward with Redis caching.

2. Unmapped Pages That Do Not Appear in Frontend Categories

During the ingestion process (e.g., /blogs/slug), we identified many pages that exist in the backend but do not appear under any frontend categories. They are accessible directly through URLs like:

https://example.com/slug


However, we cannot determine where they belong within the site's structure, and they are not being detected automatically by the pipeline.

To proceed correctly, I need clarification on these pages:

Should these pages be included in the new structure?

Are they legacy pages that should be excluded?

Should they be assigned to a category, or handled separately?

Knowing how to treat these unmapped pages will allow us to finalize the ingestion pipeline and ensure complete, accurate content coverage.

Please let me know your preferred direction on Redis caching and how you would like to handle the unmapped pages.

Thanks,

If you'd like, I can also prepare:

✔ A shorter version
✔ A more formal corporate version
✔ A more technical explanation for engineering leads

Just tell me!

“Do we need to show these articles or not?”
This is included clearly in the second main point.

Subject: Recommendation on Caching Strategy and Clarification Needed on Unmapped Articles

Hi [Name],

While working on the website resampling, I encountered two important points that require your guidance:

1. Recommendation: Implement Redis Caching Instead of Increasing YouTube API Quota

We recently exceeded the daily YouTube Data API v3 quota (10,000 units/day), which caused related features to stop working. After evaluating options, Redis caching is the more scalable and cost-efficient solution compared to requesting higher API quota.

Benefits of Redis caching:

Reduces API calls drastically (from thousands/day to <100/day)

Keeps us comfortably within the free quota

Improves performance under high footfall

Redis can also be reused to cache many other pages across the site, not just YouTube data

Increasing quota is not guaranteed and could lead to higher backend processing costs as traffic grows.

Therefore, I recommend proceeding with Redis caching.

2. Unmapped Articles That Do Not Appear in Any Frontend Category

During the ingestion pipeline (e.g., /blogs/slug), we discovered many articles/pages that:

Exist in the backend

Are accessible via URLs like https://example.com/slug

But do not appear under any frontend categories, and we cannot determine where they belong

To continue correctly, I need your direction on the following:

Questions:

Do these articles need to be shown on the new platform?

Should they be included in the resampling and caching workflow?

Are they legacy/unwanted pages that should be excluded?

If they should be shown, which category or section should they belong to?

Clarifying this will allow us to finalize the ingestion pipeline and ensure we only display relevant content.

Please let me know your thoughts on both the caching recommendation and how we should handle these unmapped articles.

Thanks,
