We had some really interesting discussions on the difference between the two, how you can support preference without enabling bias and why, as part of our individual growth, we should be looking within ourselves and evaluating the preferences we hold, and why we hold them.</p>\n<p>It was a great discussion – but we can only cover so much in one episode! And I still had a lot of thoughts. So, today, we’re continuing that discussion and diving deeper into what we need to know about bias.</p>\n<p>Where does it come from and how do we learn about it? How do we handle it, and where do workplaces fit in? And, most importantly, how do we call it out – not just in others, but in ourselves?</p>\n<p>Our guests will be tackling those big questions, and more, today.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 720px;\" class=\"wp-video\"><video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" id=\"video-21575-1\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\" preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"video/mp4\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Blended-42-Audiogram.mp4?_=1\" /><a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Blended-42-Audiogram.mp4\">https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Blended-42-Audiogram.mp4</a></video></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>IN THIS EPISODE WE DISCUSS:</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>[01.02] Introductions to our Blended panelists.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shimon – Technical Program Manager at Apple</li>\n<li>Margot – VP, Head of North America Diversity and Inclusion at SAP</li>\n<li>Pooja – Chief Product and Technical Officer at Honor Education</li>\n<li>Mary – Founder at Resilient Musicians Academy</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“As a black female in my 50’s, I thought bias came from just my identity, towards or against just one group. But, what I’ve learned is that, if you have a brain, you have bias!&#8230; None of us is exempt from the impacts of bias, or actually practicing various forms of bias.” Margot</p></blockquote>\n<p>[04.48] The group discussed bias – where it comes from; the role of labels and titles in excusing and promoting bias; and the top five biases Margot addresses in her role as head of diversity and inclusion.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Bias is a skill you learn, how to pattern match, so you don’t get stuck with analysis paralysis with every decision…. They’re basically shortcuts that drive our behavior. But the thing to watch out for is where are these shortcuts trying to drive you versus a larger objective… sometimes these shortcuts need to be trained out of the local orbits that they’re trying to optimize for.” Pooja</p></blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Impact of background and upbringing</li>\n<li>Impact of lived experiences</li>\n<li>Positive and negative bias</li>\n<li>How we interpret huge amounts of data</li>\n<li>Bias is natural</li>\n<li>Learned attitudes and stereotypes</li>\n<li>Socialization</li>\n<li>Perspective</li>\n<li>Calling out vs calling in</li>\n<li>Open-mindedness</li>\n<li>Opening up conversations</li>\n<li>Therapy and mental health days</li>\n<li>Empathy</li>\n<li>Is DEI biased?</li>\n<li>Leading by example</li>\n<li>Addressing your own bias first</li>\n<li>The bias of having a “go-to person” in the workplace</li>\n<li>Association bias</li>\n<li>Affinity bias</li>\n<li>Attention bias</li>\n<li>Halo effect</li>\n<li>Workplace proximity bias</li>\n<li>Excuses for bias</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“Bias are thoughts that are embedded within us because of our cultural upbringing, our surroundings – sometimes it just gets stuck as an opinion. It takes a lot of learning, and unlearning.” Shimon</p></blockquote>\n<p>[42.06] The panel shared their personal experiences of bias and reflected on what they’ve learned.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Identifying bias is a continuous process. The people, the interactions, the time – things are constantly changing. And where I feel the most work has to happen is: ‘how do you surround yourself with real feedback, where you have a chance to understand how your actions are impacting the rest?’” Pooja</p></blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Balancing affinity bias with a sense of home/comfort to be found in similar communities</li>\n<li>Conscious bias becoming unconscious bias</li>\n<li>Mary’s experience of bias within her family</li>\n<li>Comparison to others</li>\n<li>Shimon’s experience of being an Indian immigrant in the U.S.</li>\n<li>Who’s responsibility is it to tackle bias?</li>\n<li>Curiosity</li>\n<li>Society pushing us to certain timelines</li>\n<li>Ongoing learning</li>\n<li>Intent</li>\n<li>Self-awareness</li>\n<li>Pooja’s experience of missing out on opportunities because of motherhood</li>\n<li>Other people’s bias impacting your own self-belief/self-esteem</li>\n<li>Margot’s experience of education bias and impact on hiring</li>\n<li>Margot’s experience of hair bias</li>\n<li>Legacy preferences</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“You have to acknowledge that they only know what they know. Sometimes it becomes your responsibility to be open-minded… sometimes questions come from a place of curiosity, and I have to not be defensive.” Shimon</p></blockquote>\n<p>[1.06.00] The group discussed the different ways we can confront bias, personally and professionally.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Proactive approach\n<ul>\n<li>Acknowledge existence</li>\n<li>Acknowledge impacts</li>\n<li>“Going first” approach</li>\n<li>Asking others</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Reactive approach</li>\n<li>Journalling</li>\n<li>‘Circle of awareness’ and mindfulness</li>\n<li>Empathy</li>\n<li>Compassion</li>\n<li>Re-framing conversations – focus on behavior instead of attacking</li>\n<li>Safe spaces</li>\n<li>Independent learning</li>\n<li>Being vulnerable</li>\n<li>Coaching culture vs cancel culture</li>\n<li>Getting comfortable with being uncomfortable</li>\n<li>Enablement vs training</li>\n<li>Inclusive language</li>\n<li>Measure results</li>\n<li>Show outcomes</li>\n<li>Allyship</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>[01.21.25] The group sum up their thoughts from today’s discussion.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“We’re not perfect. Come from a place of intent, speak your truth, be courageous, and make a difference – be the change you want to see.” Margot</p></blockquote>\n<h2><strong>RESOURCES AND LINKS MENTIONED:</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can connect with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/margotgoodsoncpa/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Margo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/get2madette/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mary</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/pgarg/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Pooja</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/shimongowda/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Shimon</a> over on LinkedIn.</p>\n<p>If you enjoyed this episode and want to hear more, listen to <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/episode-375-blended-did-they-just-say-that-the-truth-about-microaggression/\">375 – Blended: ‘Did They Just Say That?’ The Truth About Microaggression</a> or <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/episode-323-blended-how-to-foster-an-inclusive-workplace/\">323: Blended – How to Foster an Inclusive Workplace</a>.</p>\n<p>Check out our other podcasts <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/podcast\">HERE</a>.</p>\n",

It’s episode 41, I’m joined by a new panel of professionals who are ready to be open, honest and challenge themselves with, sometimes tough, conversations. And, today, we’re talking about preference vs bias.</p>\n<p>We’ve talked a lot about bias on the show, whether it be gender, race, or class. But, equally, we talk a lot about personal choice, autonomy, and the importance of following our own paths. And, in that space, falls preference. You prefer to work from home because it suits your life better; you prefer to work with particular people because you know your personality or work ethic aligns.</p>\n<p>But what happens when the two start to overlap and the line gets blurred? When does a preference become a bias? How do you spot it? And what can you do about it?</p>\n<p>It’s complicated, but we’ll be diving into those big questions today.</p>\n<p>Our guests will be talking about what bias means and how it differs from preference; the role experience has on personal bias; if bias is always a negative; and the ways that we can tackle bias in ourselves and within our communities.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 720px;\" class=\"wp-video\"><video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" id=\"video-20021-1\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\" preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"video/mp4\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/audio1074993897_PR7g7DSK-Made-by-Headliner.mp4?_=1\" /><a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/audio1074993897_PR7g7DSK-Made-by-Headliner.mp4\">https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/audio1074993897_PR7g7DSK-Made-by-Headliner.mp4</a></video></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>IN THIS EPISODE WE DISCUSS:</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>[01.05] Introductions to our Blended panelists.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Katie – SVP of Industry Relations and Strategic Initiatives at Manifest</li>\n<li>Samantha – VP of Commercial Operations at Fleetzero</li>\n<li>George – Senior Communications Specialist at Blume Global</li>\n<li>Kate – Supply Chain Management and Marketing Student at the University of Arkansas</li>\n<li>Reema – Founder of People of Data</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[04.31] The group discusses bias and preference – what they mean, the difference between the two, and when preference becomes a bias.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“When you stop accepting other options and characteristics because you have these very strongly held beliefs… once you’ve grabbed hold of that, and you’re not open to anything else, that’s when it becomes a bias. And it becomes a negative.”  Samantha</p></blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Learned behavior</li>\n<li>Bias as negative, preference as positive</li>\n<li>Impact of bias</li>\n<li>Preference becoming bias</li>\n<li>Remaining objective</li>\n<li>Being open-minded</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“We hear about AI having a lot of bias, and therefore it’s not inclusive of certain people, groups or categories of information… data is created by humans… and the challenge then comes with the fact that we inherently, as a species, create bias in how we move through the world.” Reema</p></blockquote>\n<p>[11.01] The panel shares personal stories; discusses the impact of past experience on bias; and debates real-life examples: if you have a choice between a male and a female doctor, and you choose the female doctor, is that a preference or a bias?</p>\n<blockquote><p>“It’s natural for us to use our experiences to help us navigate our decisions moving forward. But it always comes back to us. It’s up to us to remain objective and challenge ourselves to see if what we’re doing checks out.” George</p></blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Intent</li>\n<li>Challenging yourself</li>\n<li>Self-awareness</li>\n<li>Impact of trauma</li>\n<li>Mental health</li>\n<li>Grace</li>\n<li>Empathy</li>\n<li>Unconscious bias</li>\n<li>Being willing to correct bias</li>\n<li>Allyship</li>\n<li>Hiring practices</li>\n<li>Immediate vs prolonged bias</li>\n<li>Self-disclosure</li>\n<li>Bias you can see vs bias you can’t</li>\n<li>Discrimination</li>\n<li>Assumptions</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“Our past creates our lens of perspective. We all wear metaphorical glasses and they are tinted with our perspective, our past history, our trauma. And that’s OK, as long as you’re willing to take off your glasses every now and then.” Samantha</p></blockquote>\n<p>[50.52] The group discusses where unconscious bias fits in, and whether bias is always a negative.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Where bias becomes dangerous is when you start to try and convince other people.” Katie</p></blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Stigma</li>\n<li>Is it possible to act without bias?</li>\n<li>Positive bias</li>\n<li>Awareness</li>\n<li>The constant evolution of bias</li>\n<li>Working to be better</li>\n<li>Backgrounds</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“If it starts to impact your judgement, business decisions or your personal relationships, that’s when the bias starts to become negative.” Katie</p></blockquote>\n<p>[1.00.23] The panel shares ideas and solutions for tackling bias and evaluating personal preferences.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“You need to rely on your community and your colleagues to call you out. Unconscious bias is probably the most damaging because you don’t realize you’re doing it, and it&#8217;s happening all the time. Once we can tackle some of the unconscious bias, that’s where the solution lies… we need to reframe how we’re thinking.” Katie</p></blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Questions to ask ourselves</li>\n<li>Personal journeys</li>\n<li>Holding ourselves accountable</li>\n<li>Acknowledging bias</li>\n<li>Working to understand bias</li>\n<li>Being kind to ourselves</li>\n<li>Pushing yourself out of your comfort zone</li>\n<li>Shame triggers</li>\n<li>The energy it takes to change people&#8217;s minds/fight biases</li>\n<li>Personal responsibility</li>\n<li>What you say vs how it&#8217;s received</li>\n<li>The ‘why’ behind a bias</li>\n<li>Meeting people where they are</li>\n<li>Bridging gaps</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[01.11.51] The group sums up their thoughts from today’s discussion.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“The world is bigger than us, it’s bigger than our own perspectives. And it’s our responsibility to be open and understanding of others and what they understand and experience. It’s reckless if we choose not to do that.” George</p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>RESOURCES AND LINKS MENTIONED:</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can connect with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/katie-date-89573215/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Katie</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/reemavadoliya/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Reema</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/samantha-galltin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Samantha</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/katewalker5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Kate</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/geproto/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">George</a> over on LinkedIn.</p>\n<p>If you enjoyed this episode and want to hear more conversations around bias, listen to <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/episode-334-blended-education-the-last-socially-acceptable-bias/\">334: Blended – Education: The Last Socially Acceptable Bias</a>, <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/episode252/\">252: Blended – Hiding in Plain Sight: The Reality of Workplace Discrimination</a>, or <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/episode220/\">220: Blended – Immigration and Identity</a>.</p>\n<p>Check out our other podcasts <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/podcast\">HERE</a>.</p>\n",

It’s episode 40, I’m joined by another amazing group of professionals and, today, we’re all about the positivity – because we’re talking about organizations that are doing good.</p>\n<p>We can all be guilty of being a little bit cynical sometimes when it comes to brands, especially big ones, and their impact on the world. Greenwashing and pinkwashing have both been well-publicized in recent years, as we strive towards achieving greater sustainability and more diverse cultures in business.</p>\n<p>But there are so many organizations that are doing great things – not just saying them – and making a positive impact in our world. And this episode is dedicated to them, to what we can learn, and how we can all be inspired, in our personal and professional lives, to do better.</p>\n<p>Today, our guests will be talking about the impact that businesses, large and small, have on our world; personal accountability versus corporate responsibility; the fine line between people and profit; and the different ways people and organizations can drive change and create a positive impact, locally and worldwide.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 720px;\" class=\"wp-video\"><video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" id=\"video-19726-1\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\" preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"video/mp4\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ltsc-blended-40v2-mixed-and-mastered_kFlK46BZ-Made-by-Headliner.mp4?_=1\" /><a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ltsc-blended-40v2-mixed-and-mastered_kFlK46BZ-Made-by-Headliner.mp4\">https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ltsc-blended-40v2-mixed-and-mastered_kFlK46BZ-Made-by-Headliner.mp4</a></video></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>IN THIS EPISODE WE DISCUSS:</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>[01.08] Introductions to our Blended panellists.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Leslie – Co-founding Executive Director at Next Economy Trust</li>\n<li>Serena – Owner at Pulse Marketing and author</li>\n<li>Amy – Founder at Gender Fair</li>\n<li>Emily – Chief Strategy Officer at CARE Impact Partners</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>[05.18] The group discuss personal responsibility versus the impact that big businesses have globally; and why it’s so important for organizations to take a proactive approach to doing good.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“It’s scale. To ask individuals to fix these problems that are systemic is absolutely cruel, especially when it comes to women… to put the burden on a woman, or disadvantaged person, to fix systems that weren’t built for them is wrong. ” Amy</p></blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Government and legislation</li>\n<li>Making an impact by changing the worlds biggest 2,000 businesses</li>\n<li>Responsibility of the individual to add pressure</li>\n<li>The danger in asking the people with the least power to create the most change</li>\n<li>The huge impact corporations have on the world</li>\n<li>Impact of poverty, gender inequality and climate crisis on supply chain risk</li>\n<li>Doing good with a purpose – creating the business case</li>\n<li>Improving brand reputation</li>\n<li>Driving value for shareholders</li>\n<li>Doing good internally, as well as externally\n<ul>\n<li>Hiring and retention</li>\n<li>Creating positive cultures</li>\n<li>Staff engagement and satisfaction</li>\n<li>Giving workers a voice</li>\n<li>Incentivizing doing good</li>\n<li>Empowering teams</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Creating awareness of organizations doing good</li>\n<li>Wastage</li>\n<li>Companies moving away from traditional structures of corporate social responsibility</li>\n<li>Embedding efforts into core company values</li>\n<li>Integrating social and environmental sustainability agendas</li>\n<li>Working with organizations that align with your values and ethics</li>\n<li>Taking a people-centered approach</li>\n<li>Impact of purchasing practices</li>\n<li>Circular economy</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“Companies are dependant on the ecosystems in which they operate. It’s not only important for businesses to take a proactive approach to doing good. I’d argue that it’s absolutely critical to their long-term success, specifically when we’re looking at a supply chain perspective.” Emily</p></blockquote>\n<p>[59.28] The panel discuss some of the ways that people and organizations can make a difference.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“There’s a fine line constantly between people and profit… but at the very core, at the foundation of any business, it starts with their cultural beliefs, their values, their expectations. If they’re not setting KPI’s, goals, expectations around these important topics, they’re not living and breathing it, and it’s not going to stick.” Serena.</p></blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Employee research groups</li>\n<li>Changing incentive structures</li>\n<li>Metrics for success – moving away from cost-only and typical ROI</li>\n<li>Layering a gender lens across initiatives</li>\n<li>Making commitments</li>\n<li>Giving back to local community</li>\n<li>Opening up conversations</li>\n<li>Acting with intent</li>\n<li>Shared goals</li>\n<li>B Corporations</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“It’s very important to have measurements. People want to do good, but they don’t know how… when people can see what they can do to be better, they do it; the more systems we have, the more helpful it is.” Amy</p></blockquote>\n<p>[1.15.04] The group share organizations that companies can engage with to help them do good in the world; spotlight brands that are doing good; and give suggestions for how individuals can take action.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“In order to affect change, people who are in leadership positions need to know that the rest of the public is watching.” Leslie</p></blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Blended Pledge</li>\n<li>Habitat for Humanity</li>\n<li>Tory Burch</li>\n<li>Kiva</li>\n<li>Water.org</li>\n<li>The Parks Project</li>\n<li>Vote Run Lead</li>\n<li>Moms First</li>\n<li>Billion Strong</li>\n<li>Trans New York</li>\n<li>Oddbox</li>\n<li>Mars</li>\n<li>Target</li>\n<li>Micro Scooters</li>\n<li>Vestiaire collective</li>\n<li>Buy from female-owned businesses</li>\n<li>Social media support</li>\n<li>Educate yourself on ethical practices</li>\n<li>Buy local</li>\n<li>Commitment to purpose</li>\n<li>Volunteering</li>\n<li>Accountability</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“It starts with us, with the leaders. We have to be willing, not only to sacrifice, but to fight for the things that we believe in, in order to create companies that are going to give back to everyone, where people are excited and passionate to come to work, that are making our world better. We have to change ourselves first before we can change the world.”  Serena</p></blockquote>\n<h2><strong>RESOURCES AND LINKS MENTIONED:</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can connect with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lesliehitchcock/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Leslie</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/emily-patrick-236b8331/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Emily</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/serenamastin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Serena</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/amy-willard-cross-genderfair/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Amy</a> over on LinkedIn.</p>\n<p>If you want to hear more conversations around diversity, equity and inclusion, why not check out <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/episode-366-blended-levelling-the-playing-field-what-women-have-to-think-about-vs-men/\">366: Blended – Leveling The Playing Field: What Women Have To Think About Vs Men</a> or <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/episode-323-blended-how-to-foster-an-inclusive-workplace/\">323: Blended – How to Foster an Inclusive Workplace</a>.</p>\n<p>Check out our other podcasts <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/podcast\">HERE</a>.</p>\n",

It’s episode 39, I am once again joined by a brand new group of professionals who are bringing honesty and authenticity to the table and, today, we’re taking on our most controversial topic yet – cancel culture!</p>\n<p>It’s a term that has rapidly grown over the last few years, in light of movements like Me Too and Black Lives Matter, where people in positions of power have been found to have abused those positions, without being held to account. But, despite some of the positive outcomes from those movements, cancel culture remains controversial.</p>\n<p>And so as we think about the rise of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives across the workplace, it’s important to pick apart the headlines from the realities, overlay that with wider social discussions, and get a feel for how the impact of things like cancel culture might be felt in the workplace.</p>\n<p>Today, our guests will be talking about what cancel culture actually means; how and why it’s changed; the role of social media and politics in the weaponization of cancel culture; and what organizations can do to tackle cancel culture and create thriving workplaces.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 720px;\" class=\"wp-video\"><video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" id=\"video-19656-1\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\" preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"video/mp4\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/audio1763936783_uVVaL80W-Made-by-Headliner.mp4?_=1\" /><a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/audio1763936783_uVVaL80W-Made-by-Headliner.mp4\">https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/audio1763936783_uVVaL80W-Made-by-Headliner.mp4</a></video></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>IN THIS EPISODE WE DISCUSS:</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>[01.41] Introductions to our Blended panellists.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Melody – Executive Communication Coach</li>\n<li>Deborah – Partner at Barnes &amp; Thornburg LLP and co-host of Parity podcast</li>\n<li>Parul – Supply chain leader at Yamaha Motor Canada</li>\n<li>Holly – Director of Logistics at C&amp;D Trojan</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[05.37] The group discuss what cancel culture means; how it’s changed; and why it’s grown so rapidly as a movement.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“There’s a huge conversation about what <strong><em>was</em></strong> cancel culture and what <strong><em>is</em> </strong>cancel culture now. It was originally meant to be calling out people who were hateful, who misused privilege – it’s turned into calling anyone out if there is a difference of opinion.” Parul.</p></blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Spiral of silence</li>\n<li>Echo chamber effect</li>\n<li>Avoidance of hard conversations</li>\n<li>Hiding behind social media presence</li>\n<li>Rise of social media</li>\n<li>Transparency</li>\n<li>Power</li>\n<li>Demonstrating what matters to you</li>\n<li>Impact on mental health</li>\n<li>Misunderstandings</li>\n<li>No second chances</li>\n<li>Herd mentality/bandwagon</li>\n<li>Impact of personal politics</li>\n<li>Black and white/grey areas</li>\n<li>Fear</li>\n<li>Celebrity</li>\n<li>Politics</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“It was a way, with the Me Too and Black Lives Matter movements, to bring attention to historically unheard or discounted voices.” Holly</p>\n<p>“It gives power when you feel powerless… It brings intentionality as to where and how you spend your time and money.” Melody</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">[21.07] The panel reflect on whether cancel culture has become a buzzword, and whether or not it’s overused or misunderstood.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>“There’s a moving target of the definition of right and wrong… and cancel culture is unravelling into public judgement for nearly anything you do.” Melody</p></blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Right and wrong</li>\n<li>Boycott</li>\n<li>Consequences</li>\n<li>Separating ideology and opinion from the individual</li>\n<li>Snap decisions</li>\n<li>Who’s fueling the fire?</li>\n<li>Corruption of the term itself</li>\n<li>Relationship to patriarchy and white supremacy</li>\n<li>Google reviews and impact on businesses</li>\n<li>Behavior in places like Facebook groups</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“A lot of this is as a result of our politics. We’ve come to this place where we paint people as good or bad… it robs us of nuance.” Deborah</p></blockquote>\n<p>[29.34] The group discuss how this all relates to the workplace, and whether cancel culture has impacted them professionally.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“It’s a conscious lack of empathy. People choose not to be empathetic. They don’t want to hear it, they don’t want to put themselves in your shoes – they just want to stand to the side and judge.”</p></blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Speaking up</li>\n<li>Role of HR</li>\n<li>Advocating for yourself</li>\n<li>Acknowledge different perspectives</li>\n<li>Openness and honesty</li>\n<li>Respect</li>\n<li>Intent</li>\n<li>DEI communities</li>\n<li>Debate within communities</li>\n<li>Giving grace</li>\n<li>Importance of working on yourself</li>\n<li>Listening</li>\n<li>Unconscious and conscious bias</li>\n<li>Who’s in charge of deciding what’s right and wrong?</li>\n<li>Working on interpersonal communication</li>\n<li>Walking a fine line</li>\n<li>Saying no to opportunities</li>\n<li>Saying sorry</li>\n<li>Second chances</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“It’s the same principle as a debate. The more you understand about opposing perspectives, the more persuasive and convincing you can be.” Melody</p></blockquote>\n<p>[56.00] The panel reflect on the trend of ‘automatic apologies,’ and whether or not we are we desensitized to apologies.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“I’m sorry you feel that way…”</li>\n<li>Sincerity</li>\n<li>Intentionality</li>\n<li>How we appear</li>\n<li>Realising we can’t control how others view or accept an apology</li>\n<li>Quick to judge</li>\n<li>What people feel vs what they <em>should</em> be feeling</li>\n<li>Credibility</li>\n<li>Conflict as entertainment</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>[1.06.18] The group discuss what organizations can do to combat toxic workplaces and create positive cultures.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I would encourage people to start on a 1:1 level which is most effective – when someone knows who you are, you can communicate to them why you think that type of communication is inappropriate and make the change at that level.” Melody</p></blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Top down culture</li>\n<li>One to ones</li>\n<li>Open suggestion box</li>\n<li>Anonymous staff surveys</li>\n<li>HR</li>\n<li>Individual autonomy</li>\n<li>Creating safe spaces</li>\n<li>Accountability</li>\n<li>Bridging the gap</li>\n<li>Focus on the outcome</li>\n<li>Diversity and inclusion</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“Acknowledge: ‘I don’t have answers. I am working towards a workplace I want to be a part of. I don’t know how we fix things.

It’s episode 38, we are once again joined by a fresh new panel of inspirational professionals, and today, we’re talking about microaggression.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a term you’re sure to have heard. First used around 1970 by Harvard psychiatrist, Dr. Chester Pierce, it initially described the regular insults and dismissals he witnessed, from non-black people towards the black community. But professors and social scientists have gone on to examine the concept more closely and expand our understanding of microaggressions, detailing how they also impact religious groups, gender identities, those who are living with disabilities, and the LGBTQIA+ community.</p>\n<p>So it’s really an important part of the conversations we need to have around diversity, equity, and inclusion. Microaggressions are a part of exclusionary practices and behaviors, but they can often fly under the radar, especially in the workplace.</p>\n<p>Today, our guests will be talking about what microaggressions actually are; sharing their personal experiences; reflecting on how to identify them; and, most importantly, how to tackle them.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 2160px;\" class=\"wp-video\"><video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" id=\"video-19507-1\" width=\"2160\" height=\"2160\" preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"video/mp4\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Blended-Audiogram_Episode-38.mp4?_=1\" /><a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Blended-Audiogram_Episode-38.mp4\">https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Blended-Audiogram_Episode-38.mp4</a></video></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>IN THIS EPISODE WE DISCUSS:</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>[01.27] Introductions to our Blended panelists.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sharon – Supplier Diversity Director at Radian</li>\n<li>Cathy – Vice President of Women&#8217;s Leadership and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion at American Bankers Association</li>\n<li>Ted – Principal at Firmament</li>\n<li>David – Assistant Vice President of Membership &amp; Marketing at IANA</li>\n<li>Clarecia – Professor of International Business at Algonquin College of Applied Arts and Technology</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“We’ve been so busy doing our jobs, we’ve forgotten that underneath it all, we’re people… Our differences are our strengths. If we bring all of our best to the table, that’s where the best of life and business is going to happen, but you have to create an atmosphere where everyone feels comfortable.” David</p></blockquote>\n<p>[06.52] The group discusses what microaggression means; the difference between microaggression, harassment, bullying, and discrimination; and the importance of allyship.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“It’s a subtle attack on a person, who they are, what they bring to the table… I call it front-stabbing, not back-stabbing!” Clarecia</p></blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Assumptions and cultural norms</li>\n<li>Overstepping boundaries</li>\n<li>Poor leadership</li>\n<li>Insecurity</li>\n<li>Subconscious or unconscious bias</li>\n<li>Intent</li>\n<li>Imposter syndrome</li>\n<li>Two-sided conversations</li>\n<li>Building relationships</li>\n<li>Keeping people small</li>\n<li>Perceptions and mistruths that are built into our cultures</li>\n<li>Unlearning lessons</li>\n<li>Building resilience</li>\n<li>Allyship</li>\n<li>Speaking up</li>\n<li>Education</li>\n<li>What you wear/how you look</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“It’s over-stepping that personal boundary… it’s more societal macroaggression because we all come with our own dialogues that we project out.” David</p>\n<p>“It’s a subtle, sometimes almost subconscious, reaction.” Ted</p></blockquote>\n<p>[50.17] The panel reflects on what microaggressions can look like; making underrepresented communities responsible for change; and whether a lack of diversity in workplaces is in itself a microaggression.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Everyone needs to be more conscious of the words they use.

It’s episode 37, I’m joined by another new group of professionals, who are bringing their authentic selves to conversations that matter and, today, we’re talking about the differences between what men and women have to think about when they’re out living their lives.</p>\n<p>Many of you will have seen memes or articles shared on social media with some of these differences. For example, on a night out. A woman might consider what she wears, only go out in groups, meet people in a public place, be careful not to drink too much, cover her drink to make sure no-one puts anything in it, message her friends to let them know she got home safe… Meanwhile, a guy just goes out.</p>\n<p>And that is the same for everything, from going for a jog to finding a parking space – even choosing a place to live. But it’s not something that’s talked about a lot because, for many women, it’s a fact of life. They just get on with it, and many men might not even realise the things they have to think about on a daily basis.</p>\n<p>And how does that translate to the workplace? What are women having to do or think about versus men, and how is that impacting the organizations we work for, our industry and, ultimately, the progress of diversity equity and inclusion.</p>\n<p>Today, our guests will be sharing their personal experiences; reflecting on the societal expectations for men and women and their impacts; discussing the impact of bias and stereotypes on the workplace; and sharing ideas for how we can create safe spaces for all genders to thrive.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 1080px;\" class=\"wp-video\"><video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" id=\"video-19071-1\" width=\"1080\" height=\"1080\" preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"video/mp4\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Blended-Audiogram-Episode-37.mp4?_=1\" /><a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Blended-Audiogram-Episode-37.mp4\">https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Blended-Audiogram-Episode-37.mp4</a></video></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>IN THIS EPISODE WE DISCUSS:</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>[01.30] Introductions to our Blended panellists.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lisa – CEO at EyeMail Inc</li>\n<li>Akshay – Co-Founder and CEO at Terminal49</li>\n<li>Graham – Executive Chairman at A &amp;

It’s episode 36, I’m joined by another new group of inspirational professionals and, today, we’re talking about victimhood.</p>\n<p>Now, people’s experiences of being a victim are very different – some people don’t identify with the word victim at all! But it is something that’s a big part of life for many. Every year, millions of people are a victim of a crime, and millions more suffer illness or injury.</p>\n<p>It’s safe to say that it’s an issue that we will all face in our lifetimes, in one way or another. But it’s often something people don’t talk about. Some people don’t want to be seen as a victim, and be pitied. Some people don’t want to talk about the incident that made them a victim.

It’s episode 35, I’m joined by another new panel of powerhouse professionals, and today, we’re talking about anxiety.</p>\n<p>Anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the US, affecting 40 million adults – that’s nearly 20% of the population! – every single year. And it’s common for someone with an anxiety disorder to also suffer from depression. But, despite such huge numbers, only 36% of those suffering actually receive treatment.</p>\n<p>That is a shocking figure. Millions of people are suffering in silence every day and the potential impact, on individuals and communities, is massive – leading many to say that the current mental health crisis is a ticking time bomb.</p>\n<p>So, with the likelihood that multiple people around you at work and at home are suffering – perhaps you’re even suffering yourself – it’s important that we talk about it, and learn how to better support anyone that needs help.</p>\n<p>Today, our guests will be talking all about what anxiety means to them; sharing their physical and mental triggers and symptoms; reflecting on how we can support others, personally and in the workplace; and revealing all the resources and techniques that worked for them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>IN THIS EPISODE WE DISCUSS:</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>[01.04] Introductions to our Blended panelists.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Suuchi – Founder and CEO of Suuchi Inc</li>\n<li>Isabella – Global Product Marketer at IBM Power</li>\n<li>Angela – Industry Lead for Manufacturing, Distribution, Logistics, and Retail at Hartman Executive Advisors</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[05.55] The guests discuss what anxiety means to them; the disconnect between what people think it is vs what it actually is; and their many and varied mental and physical symptoms and triggers.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“There are so many misconceptions around what anxiety really is.” Angela</p></blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Fear</li>\n<li>Worst case scenarios</li>\n<li>Good and bad anxiety</li>\n<li>Panic attacks</li>\n<li>Full-body experiences</li>\n<li>Stigma</li>\n<li>Generational trauma</li>\n<li>Opening up conversations</li>\n<li>Weakness</li>\n<li>Cortisol levels and fight or flight mode</li>\n<li>Physical and mental triggers and symptoms</li>\n<li>Highly sensitive people</li>\n<li>Research and self-awareness</li>\n<li>Control</li>\n<li>Sleep</li>\n<li>Trying to “fix things”</li>\n<li>Acknowledging anxiety to ourselves and others</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“For me, it’s the mental runaway train!” Angela</p></blockquote>\n<p>[30.55] The panel discusses the importance of communication and mindset when it comes to the journey of anxiety.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“It’s easy to push it away… we have so much compassion for each other sharing stories, but not when we’re sharing our own.” Isabella</p></blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Knowing what we need and asking for it</li>\n<li>Vulnerability</li>\n<li>Honesty</li>\n<li>Responsibility to hold it together</li>\n<li>Authenticity</li>\n<li>Helping others</li>\n<li>Differing comfort levels when it comes to being open</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“For me, it’s been mostly mental – realising I’m starting to think more negative thoughts than positive ones, especially when I have something coming up that I haven’t done before or I’m getting out of my comfort zone.” Isabella</p></blockquote>\n<p>[43.43] The group reflects on supporting others; and the role, and responsibility, of the workplace.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Honest leaders</li>\n<li>Creating opportunities to talk and listen</li>\n<li>Reassurance</li>\n<li>Cultivating safe spaces</li>\n<li>Compassion and empathy</li>\n<li>Normalizing emotions</li>\n<li>Mental health teams and days</li>\n<li>Building a variety of voices in the C Suite</li>\n<li>Training and workshops</li>\n<li>Creating opportunities for access to help</li>\n<li>Flexibility</li>\n<li>The journey</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[01.04.09] The panel discusses the resources and techniques that have been personally useful to them.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“If there’s one resource I can leave the audience with, it’s &#8216;How to Stop Worrying and Start Living&#8217; by Dale Carnegie… it’s been on my bookshelf for years, and it’s a classic.” Suuchi</p></blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Yoga</li>\n<li>Books</li>\n<li>Breathing exercises</li>\n<li>Self-reflection</li>\n<li>Understanding imposter syndrome</li>\n<li>Trying different techniques</li>\n<li>Mindfulness</li>\n<li>Being present in the moment</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[01.17.41] The group sums up their thoughts from today’s discussion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>RESOURCES AND LINKS MENTIONED:</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can connect with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/suuchi-ramesh-219480111/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Suuchi</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/isabellasrichard/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Isabella, </a>and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/angela-czajkowski-12010111/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Angela</a> over on LinkedIn.</p>\n<p>If you enjoyed this episode and want to hear more inspirational conversations around diversity, equity, and inclusion why not check out <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/episode242/\">242: Blended – OCD: Uncovering the Truth</a> or <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/episode-345-blended-emotional-recovery-the-unspoken-journey/\">345: Blended – Emotional Recovery: The Unspoken Journey</a>.</p>\n<p>Check out our other podcasts <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/podcast\">HERE</a>.</p>\n",

It’s episode 34, I’m joined by a brand new panel of inspirational professionals, and, today, we’re talking about seniority in the workplace.</p>\n<p>Now, seniority is often the goal for many of us on our career journeys, but not everyone makes it – for a variety of different reasons. And when they do make it to the top, there can often be a negative impact on those below and, in turn, on workplace cultures and overall business success.</p>\n<p>Today, our guests are talking all about what seniority means to them and how it differs from leadership; reflecting on how important job titles really are; discussing what both junior and senior team members can do to nurture better workplaces; and sharing their experiences of good and bad leadership.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>IN THIS EPISODE WE DISCUSS:</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>[00.48] Introductions to our Blended panelists.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cindy – CEO for xGlobl</li>\n<li>Shay – Senior Event &amp; Program Manager at S&amp;P Global</li>\n<li>David – Head Of Global Indirect Procurement and Supplier Diversity &amp; Equality at Logitech</li>\n<li>Stephanie – Founder of People First Workplace</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[07.55] The guests discuss what seniority means to them; the difference between seniority and leadership; and their experiences of good and bad leadership.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I very much think it’s about empowerment to make an impact. To your organization, to your industry or the wider world. It’s about having the tools at your disposal… but it’s really the team that makes the impact.” David</p></blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Seniority vs leadership</li>\n<li>Hierarchy</li>\n<li>Power</li>\n<li>Ego</li>\n<li>Longevity</li>\n<li>Status and rank</li>\n<li>Who is actually the best person for the job?</li>\n<li>People are often promoted because of the length of experience and not the ability to lead</li>\n<li>Active bias</li>\n<li>Hard and soft skills</li>\n<li>Innovation</li>\n<li>Capability</li>\n<li>Inspire others to lead</li>\n<li>Empower yourself to lead</li>\n<li>Stephanie’s experience of being told she only got the job because she was a woman</li>\n<li>Shay’s experience of being asked if she got the job by ‘playing the race card’</li>\n<li>The importance of fresh thinking from the next generation</li>\n<li>The importance of vulnerability in leadership and accepting you don’t know all the answers</li>\n<li>Open communication</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“It should be a guide, a mentor, somebody who is experienced and commands respect because of that… but, for some people, seniority means power.” Stephanie</p>\n<p>“When you have senior people that have been promoted based on length of service, they often have really strong hard skills…. But they often don’t have the soft skills &#8211; and it’s the soft skills that are important for leadership.” Shay</p></blockquote>\n<p>[38.26] The panel reflects on how different types of employment change the dynamic of seniority and leadership.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bias and discrimination around part-time workers, despite title</li>\n<li>Freelancing and gig work culture</li>\n<li>Perception of what it means to be a senior leader</li>\n<li>Companies are not set up to support project-based freelance workstyles</li>\n<li>Traditional infrastructure feeds into bias and hierarchy</li>\n<li>Responsibility of leaders</li>\n<li>Leaders as coaches</li>\n<li>Accountability</li>\n<li>Top-down approaches</li>\n<li>Role of HR to enforce culture</li>\n<li>How much can teams manage up?</li>\n<li>Anonymous reporting</li>\n<li>Impact of reporting on relationships, opportunities, and job security</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[55.38] The group discusses the issue of ego, power, and the weight we put on job titles.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Titles should define what you do</li>\n<li>Ability to choose/contribute to your own title</li>\n<li>Titles important for responsibility and accountability</li>\n<li>Titles important for hiring/recruitment</li>\n<li>Titles linked to salary</li>\n<li>Loss of titles</li>\n<li>Impact on mental health</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“It’s the ego and the power side of it – if we could let that go, and if title can just be for the purpose of identification, it could really make a positive change in the working environment and culture within most organizations.” Shay</p></blockquote>\n<p>[1.05.07] The panel share their ideas and solutions for creating more equitable workplaces.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reverse mentoring</li>\n<li>Asking the right questions</li>\n<li>Remembering your younger you</li>\n<li>Allowing yourself to be open</li>\n<li>Creating a people-first culture</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“You need to be able to have communication as if there are no titles and hierarchies.” David</p></blockquote>\n<p>[01.13.33] The group sums up their thoughts from today’s discussion.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Be the leader that you want your leader to be.” Stephanie</p></blockquote>\n<h2><strong>RESOURCES AND LINKS MENTIONED:</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can connect with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-latten/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">David</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/shay-abrahams/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Shay</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephleeuk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Stephanie</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/cindygchristensen/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Cindy</a> over on LinkedIn.</p>\n<p>If you enjoyed this episode and want to hear more inspirational conversations around diversity, equity, and inclusion why not check out <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/episode265/\">265: Blended – DEI in the Workplace – Not Just The Smart Thing To Do, But The Right Thing To Do</a> or <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/episode-323-blended-how-to-foster-an-inclusive-workplace/\">323: Blended – How to Foster an Inclusive Workplace</a>.</p>\n<p>Check out our other podcasts <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/podcast\">HERE</a>.</p>\n",

It’s episode 33, I’m joined by a brand new panel of fantastic professionals, and today, we’re talking about surgery, illness, and emotional recovery.</p>\n<p>Like many people, this wasn’t something I ever really thought about – until I had to face it myself. In March 2022, I had the first of two surgeries two, hopefully, cure a condition that I’d had (although I didn’t know what it was) for 15 years. And it exposed me to a lot – pain, panic attacks, poor mental health… all while trying to carry on with work and paint on a smile for the rest of the world.</p>\n<p>I’m in a much better place now, but it’s been an experience that has really made me think. And, it made me realize how little we really know if we haven’t been through something ourselves. So I thought it was an important topic for Blended because, although we might not talk about it, experiences like this are happening to a lot more people than we might realize.</p>\n<p>So today, our guests will be revealing their stories and personal experiences; reflecting on how we can open up conversations and better support others; and sharing their words of advice.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><strong>IN THIS EPISODE WE DISCUSS:</strong></h1>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>[01.07] Introductions to our Blended panelists.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Any activity of daily living, someone has to do for me. The thing that I can do is run my mouth!” LaMondre</p></blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Melissa – Associate Partner of Finance &amp; Supply Chain Transformation at IBM</li>\n<li>LaMondre – Speaker and CEO at Billion Strong</li>\n<li>Dan – Owner at High-Performance Logistics Sales</li>\n<li>Richard – Vice President of Strategic Accounts at Intelligent Audit</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“My value and contributions were not diminished because of my diagnosis.” Melissa</p></blockquote>\n<p>[06.03] The guests share their different personal experiences of illness, surgery, and emotional recovery.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“After surgery, I was fine for the first couple of days… but then my panic attacks came back after 11 years. And so the emotional recovery from that first surgery hit me like a ton of bricks, and it’s still taking some time to work through it.” Sarah</p></blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Sarah’s experience with Lipoedema</li>\n<li>Lack of help/disbelief from medical practitioners</li>\n<li>Dan’s experience with throat cancer</li>\n<li>The journey of the caretaker</li>\n<li>Impact on relationships</li>\n<li>PTSD, anxiety, and depression</li>\n<li>Fear of returning to work</li>\n<li>Comparison</li>\n<li>LaMondre’s experience of spinal muscular atrophy</li>\n<li>Loss of ability</li>\n<li>Therapy</li>\n<li>How surgery can trigger past trauma</li>\n<li>Richard’s experience of caring for his father</li>\n<li>Denial</li>\n<li>Melissa’s experience with breast cancer</li>\n<li>Why people keep diagnoses a secret</li>\n<li>Ableism</li>\n<li>Changing perspectives</li>\n<li>Lack of understanding and awareness</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“For me, I had a lot of complications with recovery. The treatment was the ‘easy’ part… from an emotional standpoint, your perspective changes on a lot of things, including what you want to accomplish in life.” Dan</p>\n<p>“I didn’t want to tell anyone because I didn’t want people to feel sorry for me…. But finally I realised that everyone has someone that’s going through something.” Richard</p></blockquote>\n<p>[54.20] The panel reflects on how we talk about illness and recovery, and how we can better support friends, family, and colleagues.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Most people are open if you simply ask… and, be good with the answer!” LaMondre</p></blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Vulnerability</li>\n<li>Honesty</li>\n<li>Taking the burden of reaching out off the person suffering</li>\n<li>If you ask, be open to receiving the answer – whatever that is</li>\n<li>Different perspectives</li>\n<li>Showing people they’re loved</li>\n<li>Asking for help</li>\n<li>Practical support like bringing food</li>\n<li>Stigma and shame</li>\n<li>Secrecy and privacy</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“When I had cancer and I did tell somebody, the first thing I got was “Oh, I’m sorry.” I kept hearing the word sorry…” Melissa</p>\n<p>“We don’t know what anyone’s going through… so all we can control is our responses. And our responses in all areas should be love.” Richard</p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">[01.19.03] The group sums up their thoughts from today’s discussion. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p>“So many of us have to work through trauma, but once you deal with it, there’s a level of empowerment and awakening and, for me, I’ve then wanted to usher people into that space because there’s peace, serenity and confidence that comes from that.” LaMondre</p></blockquote>\n<h1><strong>RESOURCES AND LINKS MENTIONED:</strong></h1>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can connect with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/m-drew/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Melissa</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lamondre-pough-b178a09/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">LaMondre</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-deigan-07915b3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Dan</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-perry/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Richard</a> on LinkedIn.</p>\n<p>If you enjoyed this episode, why not check out <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/episode186/\">186: Blended – My Journey</a> or <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/158-blended-story-of-my-life/\">158: Blended – Story of My Life</a>.</p>\n<p>Check out our other podcasts <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/podcast\">HERE</a>.</p>\n",

Steve wants to bring vivaciousness to the shipping industry and he’s certainly doing that! Tune in for his take on why students are flocking to supply chain; why FMC offers false hope to shippers; and the big question on everyone’s lips: exactly what is happening in the ocean market?!</p>\n<p>There is so much to get your teeth into in this episode so grab a cup of coffee, and enjoy!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><strong>IN THIS EPISODE WE DISCUSS:</strong></h1>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>[07.00] From the <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/episode-336-women-in-supply-chain-liz-decker/\">latest episode of Women In Supply Chain™</a> to an introduction to the brand new private network, <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/have-you-heard-something-big-is-coming-to-supply-chain/\">The Secret Society of Supply Chain</a>, an update on the latest at Let’s Talk Supply Chain.</p>\n<p>[09.37] An introduction to Steve Ferreira; his vivacious approach to social media; and his business, Ocean Audit.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“My claim to fame is helping importers and exporters recover lost costs from the container get-in period… it only takes 50 containers to produce a $100,000 dollar refund.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[12.31] Sarah shares the responses to her question of the week: “What characteristics or skills do you admire in a leader?”, and Steve reflects on the importance of a mindset shift towards empathy in the workplace.</p>\n<p>[14.30] Steve gives us an update on the ocean market, sharing insights on rates, carrier strategies, and why more deals are getting done.</p>\n<p>[16.50] The concept behind the video that won Steve the very first pair of limited edition Let’s Talk Supply Chain custom Air Force Ones in our five-year anniversary contest; and what’s coming up for Steve and his own industry brand.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I’m a free spirit in the industry.. so I created ocean freight TV… and it’s geared towards bringing some excitement and enthusiasm into the ocean industry!”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[20.53] Sarah and Steve discuss why students are flocking to supply chain; and Steve shares his thoughts on the so-called industry talent shortage, the lack of mentors across the industry, and his words of advice for the next generation.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Our lives are so different… we never experience the same thing. The cadence, the pace and the opportunities in the supply chain are one of the top areas of opportunity, and that’s why we have so many young people flocking to the industry.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[26.38] Steve discusses his recent article: <a href=\"https://oceanauditor.com/fmc-offers-false-hopes-to-shippers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Why FMC Offers False Hope To Shippers</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“The problem is that the FMC is not an auditing agency. They’re looking for violations… where they can penalize an ocean vendor. They weren’t set up to repatriate money back to clients.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[33.06] Sarah and Steve discuss a recent <a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/mixed-signals-container-shipping-downturn-not-following-the-script\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Freight Waves article</a> suggesting that, despite the current turbulent market, the container shipping industry is not behaving like an industry facing an imminent crisis.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><strong>RESOURCES AND LINKS MENTIONED:</strong></h1>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can find out more about Ocean Audit over on their <a href=\"https://oceanauditor.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">website</a>, or you can connect with Steve on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/steveaferreira/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">LinkedIn</a>.</p>\n<p>If you enjoyed this episode and want to hear more from ‘the best 30 minutes on a Tuesday, check out <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/thoughts-and-coffee/\">Thought’s and Coffee</a> – where the best industry players discuss breaking supply chain news over a good old cup of Joe!</p>\n<p>Check out our other podcasts <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/podcast/\">HERE</a>.<br /><iframe style=\"display:block;\"  src=\"https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/26910300/height/360/theme/standard/thumbnail/no/direction/forward/\" width=\"100%\" scrolling=\"no\" class=\"podcast-class\" frameborder=\"0\" placement=\"bottom\" primary_content_url=\"http://chtbl.com/track/744833/traffic.libsyn.com/2babestalksupplychain/LTSC_340_MIXED_AND_MASTERED.mp3\" libsyn_item_id=\"26910300\" height=\"360\" theme=\"standard\" custom_color=\"75942D\"></iframe></p>\n",

It’s episode 32, I’m joined by a brand new panel of fantastic professionals and, today, we’re talking about introverts vs extroverts.</p>\n<p>Most of us, in our lives and careers, have considered what personality type we are. You might be a self-identifying Type A personality (which I know one or two of my guests today are!) In many workplaces you might even have undergone a personality test, so leadership can get a greater idea of individuals strengths and weaknesses.</p>\n<p>And one factor that&#8217;s at the core of many personality assessments is whether you are introverted or extroverted. But the introverts vs extroverts question is pretty complex – it&#8217;s about way more than if you’re quiet or chatty. And since understanding introversion and extroversion can help you understand yourself and others better, we thought it was a really interesting topic to discuss here on Blended.</p>\n<p>So today, our guests will be diving into what these words actually mean and the qualities we associate with them; sharing their own experiences; reflecting on why society values extroversion so highly; and sharing their words of advice for how organizations can better support all personality types in the workplace.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>IN THIS EPISODE WE DISCUSS:</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>[01.09] Introductions to our Blended panellists.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Jennifer – Owner and CEO at The MJW Group</li>\n<li>Elouise – Partner at Kearney</li>\n<li>Cathy – Vice president of Women’s Leadership and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion at American Bankers Association</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[03.48] The group discuss the definitions of introvert and extrovert, and reflect on what the words mean to them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The qualities or personality traits we associate with each</li>\n<li>Are introverts actually shy?</li>\n<li>Introverts are impacted, whereas extroverts are activated, by stimuli</li>\n<li>Combining introvert and extrovert qualities</li>\n<li>Differing lengths of time you can maintain extroversion</li>\n<li>Control</li>\n<li>Small talk</li>\n<li>Playing the game</li>\n<li>Exhaustion from social situations</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“I’m an introvert… but I’m a public speaker and I love it! But there’s a difference, because it’s a situation that I control… and it’s one-directional.” Elouise</p></blockquote>\n<p>[16.05] The panel talk about labels, and whether there is still value in personality testing in the workplace.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Personalities are a journey</li>\n<li>Pidgeon-holing people</li>\n<li>Moving beyond labels</li>\n<li>Self-discovery</li>\n<li>People first</li>\n<li>Bias</li>\n<li>Time, patience and compromise</li>\n<li>Safe spaces</li>\n<li>How Elouise’s transition led her to seeming more extroverted, but in reality it was happiness</li>\n<li>Empathy</li>\n<li>Flexibility</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“Education around how different people communicate in different ways is important. We make assumptions about people based upon how we communicate, our world vision, and we may be inaccurately assessing someone’s confidence, competence or leadership skills because they’re communicating in a different way and we’re interpreting that incorrectly.”  Cathy</p></blockquote>\n<p>[38.21] The group share their personal experiences of introversion and extroversion, and how those experiences have impacted them professionally and personally.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Societal celebration of extroversion</li>\n<li>Feeling self-conscious or ashamed if you don’t speak in a group setting</li>\n<li>Using note-taking as a safe way to insert your voice</li>\n<li>Becoming comfortable with not speaking if there’s nothing that needs to be said</li>\n<li>Putting people on the spot</li>\n<li>Understanding your own limits</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[50.57] The panel reflect on why society values extroversion so highly, and the unseen value of introverts.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not encouraging people to change who they are</li>\n<li>Acceptance</li>\n<li>Education</li>\n<li>Visibility</li>\n<li>Authenticity</li>\n<li>Confusing speaking with value</li>\n<li>Hidden value of introverts</li>\n<li>Personal energy</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“It comes down to politics… he who speaks the loudest gets heard, and that’s encouraged.” Jennifer</p></blockquote>\n<p>[01.01.54] The group share advice for managing introverts and extroverts in the workplace, and being a better colleague.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Education</li>\n<li>Strategies for running meetings</li>\n<li>Time for quiet reflection</li>\n<li>Balance</li>\n<li>Encouragement</li>\n<li>Boundaries</li>\n<li>Taking help or opportunities that are offered</li>\n<li>Self-care</li>\n<li>Self-belief</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[01.08.09] The panel sum-up their thoughts from today’s discussion.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Whether you’re an introvert or an extrovert, find the person that you vibe with.” Jennifer</p></blockquote>\n<h2><strong>RESOURCES AND LINKS MENTIONED:</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can connect with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifermw/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Jennifer</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/drelouise/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Elouise</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/cathy-nestrick-88222426/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Cathy</a> and over on LinkedIn.</p>\n<p>If you enjoyed this episode, why not check out <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/episode247/\">247: Blended – The Difference Between Culture and Community: What Can We Learn?</a> or <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/episode-210/\">210: Blended – Don’t forget the ‘T’: Talking Trans</a>.</p>\n<p>Check out our other podcasts <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/podcast\">HERE</a>.</p>\n",

    "web_content": "<p>In today’s episode of Women In Supply Chain™, I’m joined by Liz Decker, a truly passionate and dynamic leader at one of Inc’s Best Workplaces in America.</p>\n<p>Liz has a decade of broad experience across supply chain, having honed her expertise in all modes of logistics, covering international import/export, domestic truckload, drayage, customs brokerage, LTL, and air freight. From leading continuous improvement projects for Fortune 500 companies to leading SMB entrepreneurs through their first-ever international shipment, Liz is as versatile as she is dedicated. And she’s currently bringing her expertise and passion to her role as Director of Client Success at NorthPoint Logistics.</p>\n<p>Today Liz will be talking to us about her career so far; her passion for social causes; the importance of putting a focus on client success; and why she’s proud to say that she’s a jack-of-all-trades when it comes to supply chain. Plus, she’ll be sharing her experiences as a woman in supply chain, as well as her words of advice for all of the women following in her footsteps.</p>\n<h2><strong>SHOW SPONSOR: </strong></h2>\n<p>Women fuel the success of some of the world’s most successful businesses, yet barriers still exist.

I need my product, and I need it now.’… so it forced me to be creative, and learn the different aspects of our business.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[14.43] Liz’s current role as Director of Client Success at NorthPoint Logistics; her experience of building a team from the ground up; and why she loves building relationships.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“There’s no playbook of what client success looks like in the logistics industry – an industry that has traditionally been transactional.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[17.58] The biggest challenges that Liz&#8217;s client success team face, and the importance of tackling obstacles with strategic thinking.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“My team&#8217;s role is to advise. Here’s what we’re seeing, here’s what we’re hearing, here’s some data we can provide.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[23.24] Liz’s thoughts on the cyclical nature of supply chain trends, and what the next few years might bring for the industry.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“It’s a people industry. As technology gets better, and as people adopt technology (because we are lagging), our scope will change… but no matter how much technology we have, someone has to be there.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[26.22] The importance of good workplace culture, and what Liz has learned working at NorthPoint Logistics &#8211; one of Inc’s Best Workplaces in America.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Culture isn’t something that you just check a box and it’s there. You have to make a conscious effort every single day… but it’s so easy for culture to slip away. Being vulnerable and transparent has been so important for me.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[30.13] Liz’s passion for volunteering and charity work, and why more organizations should be supporting social causes and local communities.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“We talk about advocating for ourselves as women… and here’s my chance to advocate for someone who maybe can’t for themselves, or has some obstacles that I don’t have.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[34.20] Why people are Liz’s passion and daily inspiration.</p>\n<p>[35.08] Liz’s experience as a woman in supply chain; the power of social media; and her words of advice for women in the industry.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I never had a mentor, but social media is a great thing.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[39.30] The future for Liz.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>RESOURCES AND LINKS MENTIONED:</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can connect with Liz over on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/emdecker/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">LinkedIn</a>.</p>\n<p>If you enjoyed this episode and want to hear more from women who are passionate about client success, check out <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/episode-305-driving-your-parcel-performance-check-engine-light/\">305: Driving Your Parcel Performance: Check Engine Light</a>, featuring Elle Brown, Senior Client Success Manager at Sifted, or <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/episode255/\">255: Women In Supply Chain™</a>, featuring Mardi Tegmeyer, Customer Success Manager at Emerge.</p>\n<p>Check out our other podcasts <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/podcast/\">HERE</a>.<br /><iframe style=\"display:block;\"  src=\"https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/26686590/height/360/theme/standard/thumbnail/no/direction/forward/\" width=\"100%\" scrolling=\"no\" class=\"podcast-class\" frameborder=\"0\" placement=\"bottom\" primary_content_url=\"http://chtbl.com/track/744833/traffic.libsyn.com/2babestalksupplychain/LTSC_336_MIXED_AND_MASTERED.mp3\" libsyn_item_id=\"26686590\" height=\"360\" theme=\"standard\" custom_color=\"75942D\"></iframe></p>\n",

It’s episode 31, I’m joined by a brand new panel of inspirational professionals and, today, we’re talking about education and bias.</p>\n<p>It’s a topic that’s close to my heart, with my own educational and career journey. And, it’s a topic that has increasingly come under the spotlight recently in light of the labor shortages and trending workplace changes we’ve seen industry-wide. So now is the perfect time to really explore what’s going wrong, or right, with the way we think about education in the workplace.</p>\n<p>Today, our guests will be diving into education and sharing their own experiences; exploring the hiring practices that often continue to support bias; reflecting on what the next generation are doing and thinking about when it comes to education and their careers; and sharing their words of advice for how organizations can tackle education bias and create more diverse workplaces.</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2><strong>IN THIS EPISODE WE DISCUSS:</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>[00.44] Introductions to our Blended panellists.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rose – CEO and Principal Consultant at The Opening Door</li>\n<li>Jennifer – Executive Director at TMSA (Transportation Marketing and Sales Association)</li>\n<li>Stella – Professor at Towson University</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“Education bias is somebody being treated differently, or unfavorably, based on their educational background, where they went to school and what level of education they have.” Rose</p></blockquote>\n<p>[02.32] The group give an overview of education bias, and what it means to them.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“It was instilled in me from the second I was born: education, education, education… When I finished my degree, I felt that if I wanted to make more money, if I wanted to really excel in the corporate world, I had to have an MBA. And it took me a long time to think deeper about why I felt that way, and if I really needed it to be successful. ” Rose</p></blockquote>\n<p>[05.09] The panel share their personal experiences, their level of education and how important it has been to their professional career.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sarah’s experience of ‘only’ gaining a high school diploma; then studying at night school, trying different things, and gaining certifications whilst working, in order to boost her professional career</li>\n<li>Different types of education, eg. degree vs industry certifications, high school vs. higher education</li>\n<li>Stella’s experience of switching fields from her degree to her master’s; how a previous employer allowed her flexibility to pursue a PhD; and why she ultimately changed career, from the pharmaceutical industry to academia</li>\n<li>Stella’s experience of opportunity in America versus in India, and her parents encouragement of higher education</li>\n<li>Rose’s experience of being raised with the importance of education, and finally coming to terms with the fact that it might not be as important as she was raised to believe</li>\n<li>The assumption that additional education equals money and success</li>\n<li>The cost of education</li>\n<li>Jennifer’s experience of teaching at a community college, and as a parent of a child with ADHD</li>\n<li>Continued education in the workplace</li>\n<li>Responsibility</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“Companies say ‘we want to retain more employees, what can we do?’ Well, help develop them! Develop them, make them want to stay with you. Sometimes simple questions have simple answers, we just have to take the time.” Jennifer</p></blockquote>\n<p>[23.14] The group discuss education bias within industry, and the age-old debate of experience vs education.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“To be on a tenure track, you typically have to have a PhD. And then once you get into your field, then it becomes rank – are you an assistant professor, associate professor or professor – so you still have a PhD, but rank becomes an issue.” Stella</p></blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Stella’s experience working in academia</li>\n<li>Differing ranks and salaries within the workplace, even with the same level of education</li>\n<li>Stereotypes and judgements about different types of PhD, eg ‘they’re just liberal arts’</li>\n<li>Elitism</li>\n<li>Ego</li>\n<li>Affinity bias</li>\n<li>Importance of diversity</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“It’s hard to acknowledge and recognize your ego… but if we build more self-awareness, we can start to realise when our ego is leading things in the wrong direction, and the more we address that, we would see less bias.” Rose</p></blockquote>\n<p>[38.57] The panel reflect on what they’re seeing in the market around education bias and hiring practices.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Job descriptions</li>\n<li>Expectations</li>\n<li>The importance of not dismissing people if they don’t have the ‘perfect’ educational background</li>\n<li>Using technology to pre-filter applications</li>\n<li>Asking the right questions</li>\n<li>Role of HR – who is hiring/writing job descriptions?</li>\n<li>Input from the team who will work with new hires</li>\n<li>The pace of evolving technology – education getting out of date</li>\n<li>The structure of a resume</li>\n<li>How many years’ experience equals a degree?</li>\n<li>What do you actually want out of your career?</li>\n<li>Self-taught knowledge</li>\n<li>Power of self-belief</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“I think we put too much emphasis on education and not experience, but there is a catch 22. Because the requirement for an entry level job is 5 years – that doesn’t make sense!” Jennifer</p></blockquote>\n<p>[54.13] The group put the spotlight on the next generation, and what they’re thinking about when it comes to education and ongoing learning.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Need for more authenticity in the workplace</li>\n<li>Young people building personal brands</li>\n<li>Exploration of self-employment and entrepreneurship</li>\n<li>Greater understanding of new technologies</li>\n<li>Giving people a chance</li>\n<li>Parents, educational institutions and communities working together</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>[1.04.57] The panel sums up their thoughts from today’s discussion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>RESOURCES AND LINKS MENTIONED:</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can connect with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosegenele/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Rose</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenkarpusromain/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Jennifer</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stellatomasi-phd-mis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Stella</a> over on LinkedIn.</p>\n<p>If you enjoyed this episode and want to hear more, why not check out <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/episode-328-blended-breaking-the-class-ceiling/\">328: Blended – Breaking the Class Ceiling</a>, or <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/episode265/\">265: Blended – DEI in the Workplace – Not Just The Smart Thing To Do, But The Right Thing To Do</a>.</p>\n<p>Check out our other podcasts <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/podcast\">HERE</a>.</p>\n",

But, sadly, studies show that it’s alive and well – and its impacts are huge. The bottom 80% of the United States holds only 12% of its wealth; the bottom 60%, is just 3% of its wealth. And despite this huge disparity, little is being done to drive change.</p>\n<p>In a world where we’re working hard to tackle issues around gender, race, sexuality, religion and more – why are conversations around socioeconomic groupings still so often missing from the conversation? Surely it’s high time we address class barriers, build bridges and work harder to become a more equitable society.</p>\n<p>So today, our guests will be diving into classism and what it means to them; sharing their personal experiences; reflecting on education, privilege and pedigree; and discussing what organizations can do to tackle classism in the workplace and create more truly diverse communities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>IN THIS EPISODE WE DISCUSS:</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>[01.01] Introductions to our Blended panelists.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Elise – VP of Customer Experience at Parade</li>\n<li>Courtney – Co-founder and CEO of Renewal Logistics and ReNew</li>\n<li>Amanda – Associate Director at Savills</li>\n<li>Christine – VP of Product Marketing and Go-to-Market at Nulogy</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“When I think about classism, it’s really class discrimination. We live in a system where people are valued and treated differently based on their perceived class…. It’s so systemic and it reaches every single part of our system.”  Elise</p></blockquote>\n<p>[05.27] The group discusses classism, the complex issues that feed into it, and what classism means to them.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“It goes beyond how others perceive you – classism is also about how you perceive yourself. You grow up in a particular socio-economic group, and often you can self-limit.”</p></blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>How others see us</li>\n<li>How we see ourselves</li>\n<li>Self-sabotage</li>\n<li>Imposter syndrome and mindset</li>\n<li>Privilege</li>\n<li>Access to/relationship with education</li>\n<li>Etiquette and formality</li>\n<li>Generational money/mindset/networks</li>\n<li>Communication between classes</li>\n<li>Building communities and relationships</li>\n<li>Meritocracy</li>\n<li>Criminalization of poverty</li>\n<li>Entrepreneurship, financial security as a safety net and how money allows you to take more risks</li>\n<li>Perceptions, and Illusions of social media</li>\n<li>Power of networks</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“We would be so much further along as a society if everyone was comfortable talking to other people with an open mind, more like ‘what can I learn from this conversation’ rather than ‘what am I going to disagree with.’” Courtney</p></blockquote>\n<p>[47.17] The panel shares their experiences of classism in the workplace, and the impact of pedigree and education.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I didn’t think I was enough, I’m not good enough, I don’t have the pedigree – I never saw myself being someone that could be at an elite level. And it wasn’t because intellectually I wasn’t enough, it was because of that class that I was born in and what I saw all around me.” Christine</p></blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Christine’s experience of educational hierarchy and her reflections on classism in the Ivy League</li>\n<li>Elise’s experience of start-ups, the ‘typical’ type of founder, leader and C Suite member, the ‘boys club’ and how she developed her own biases</li>\n<li>How we can work on ourselves and tackle bias</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[58.02] The group share their ideas for how organizations can help to tackle classism in the workplace.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Amanda shares how Savills are helping to support young people entering real estate</li>\n<li>The importance of mentors</li>\n<li>Stepping out of your comfort zone</li>\n<li>Celebrating small wins and sharing expectations</li>\n<li>Creating opportunities for success</li>\n<li>Creating development plans for staff</li>\n<li>Respect</li>\n<li>Thinking about people holistically and making changes</li>\n<li>Innovative thinking</li>\n<li>Potential classism in remote work</li>\n<li>Ensuring class is part of DEI policy</li>\n<li>Team-building</li>\n<li>Education and training</li>\n<li>Translating values into behaviors</li>\n<li>Tackling classism through supplier diversity</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“It’s the subtle shift from looking for culture fit, to looking at culture add… we want someone to both support and challenge.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[1.22.37] The panel sums up their thoughts from today’s discussion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>RESOURCES AND LINKS MENTIONED:</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can connect with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/eliseanle/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Elise</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/courtney-folk-9a7a8a20/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Courtney</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/amandamontanez/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Amanda</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/cmbarnhart/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Christine</a> over on LinkedIn.</p>\n<p>If you enjoyed this episode and want to hear more, why not check out <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/episode-215/\">215: Blended – Shining a light on social inequality</a>, or <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/episode-323-blended-how-to-foster-an-inclusive-workplace/\">323: Blended – How to Foster an Inclusive Workplace</a>.</p>\n<p>Check out our other podcasts <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/podcast\">HERE</a>.</p>\n",

But there’s a real wrestle with that, as a founder.” Jonathan</p></blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Margo – aka CargoMargo and Director of Sales at NFI</li>\n<li>Jonathan – CEO of Shipz and host of Let’s Talk Supply Chain AsiaPac</li>\n<li>Caralynn – Marketing and Content Team Lead at AuditMiner</li>\n<li>Jason – Brand Director at Supply Chain and Green</li>\n<li>Lisa – Supply Chain Manager</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“The best views are from the highest climbs.” Margo</p></blockquote>\n<p>[08.56] The group shares their personal experiences of parenthood – the ups, downs and in-betweens – and how they relate to the workplace.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I learned growing up that you can do it all: you can be a Mom and you can be successful in your career, and I took that with me coming into the working world.” Caralynn</p></blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Caralynn’s experience as an only child with a successful working mother</li>\n<li>Jason’s experience as a busy working father</li>\n<li>Fear of missing out</li>\n<li>Pride in seeing your children grow, and seeing their goals met and achievements reached</li>\n<li>Special moments missed due to work</li>\n<li>Mom/Dad guilt</li>\n<li>How technology can help</li>\n<li>Lisa’s experience of re-entering the workplace, and now helping other women do the same</li>\n<li>Gender pay gap</li>\n<li>Men as allies</li>\n<li>Influencing your own children to make the impact we need to see in the future</li>\n<li>Jonathan’s experience as a founder and father of four</li>\n<li>Feelings of anger, resentment and being trapped within the workplace</li>\n<li>Finding the balance</li>\n<li>As a father, not being consumed by responsibility and providing for the family</li>\n<li>Better accommodating mothers and their needs in the workplace</li>\n<li>Margo&#8217;s experience of mothers wearing negative experiences as a badge of honor</li>\n<li>Length of maternity leave</li>\n<li>Expense of childcare</li>\n<li>Work expectations placed on women during maternity leave or even labor</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“You can only do what you can do… but technology has been a great thing – if I’m missing one of my son’s games, I get to watch it on my mobile device.” Jason</p></blockquote>\n<p>[30.19] The panel discusses maternity, paternity and grievance leave, and how the different lengths of time offered impact parents.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I set more boundaries than my Mom, and I think that’s the biggest difference generationally… if we can learn that a young age, it’s so much easier for us to advocate for ourselves.” Caralynn</p></blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Men ridiculing other men for taking leave, “man up”</li>\n<li>Expectations of the next generation</li>\n<li>Policy and government</li>\n<li>Being intentional with where you work, finding the right culture</li>\n<li>Advocating for change</li>\n<li>Assumptions about mothers</li>\n<li>Other paths to parenthood, eg surrogacy, adoption, step-parents</li>\n<li>Treating people as individuals</li>\n<li>Setting boundaries</li>\n<li>How your upbringing impacts your approach to work</li>\n<li>Fear</li>\n<li>Supporting partners after birth, not just the children</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“There’s a focus on productivity over parenting.” Jason</p></blockquote>\n<p>[1.07.01] The group discusses the many and varied transferrable skills that parents can translate from the home to the workplace, and what employers can do better to help parents thrive in the workplace.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I was fortunate to be home with our guys, which I’m very thankful and grateful for, but when you go to get back to work, it’s a huge challenge&#8230;

She has held various leadership roles at SAP over the last ten years and currently serves as the Senior Vice President of Digital Supply Chain and Industry 4.0 for SAP North America. Darcy is passionate about collaboration, and committed to guiding organizations in their digital transformation journey through innovative technology and next-generation business processes.</p>\n<p>Today Darcy will be talking to us about her career so far; the role of sponsors, as well as mentors; building a support network for women; and putting a focus on helping companies build resilient, agile, and sustainable supply chains. Plus, she’ll be sharing her experiences as a woman in supply chain, as well as her words of advice for all of the women following in her footsteps.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>SHOW SPONSOR: </strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Women fuel the success of some of the world’s most successful businesses, yet barriers still exist. SAP is committed to supporting and elevating a new generation of women to profoundly lead and impact global supply chains and are proud to support the Women In Supply Chain™ Series and its efforts.</p>\n<p>Supply chains need to evolve from low-cost and optimized to risk-resilient and sustainable and SAP can help.</p>\n<p>SAP Digital Supply Chain solutions connect the entire process — design, planning, manufacturing, logistics, maintenance, and service; connecting your supply chains to the rest of your business and all your contextual data; supporting your efforts in alleviating risk in your supply chains.</p>\n<p>SAP is the market leader in enterprise application software and for the last 50 years has been helping companies to run better.

You just don’t have the confidence yet.&#8217;”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[16.59] Why Darcy joined SAP, her journey at the brand over the past 11 years and why she’s so passionate about it.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“When you work at a smaller niche company, many times you look around the room and you’re the most experienced person there. I wanted to learn from senior executives, the best in the world, and really grow myself as a leader.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[20.33] Darcy’s current role as Senior VP of Digital Supply Chain and Manufacturing for North America, the increasing importance of digital transformation, and what she sees from her perspective at SAP.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“It’s a journey. But the good news is that digital transformation is finally starting… you don’t transform overnight but you have to have a plan, and you have to start now.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[25.34] The importance of tackling sustainability in supply chain, alongside risk, agility and resilience.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“We all know it’s the right thing to do… but if you want the best people, they want to work for sustainable companies; if you want customers, they want to buy from sustainable companies – so it makes good business sense.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[29.06] Darcy’s experience as a woman in a male-dominated industry across her 30-year career.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“It has changed, but not to the extent that I thought it would have, by the time my daughter came into the industry.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[34.23] Why Darcy established the award-winning Women In Supply Chain™ Network, and the impact it’s having on the community.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“It’s great for the career path if you have aspirations to be in the C Suite – supply chain is a great background to have, because of the visibility you get across different industries.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[36.43] The difference between mentors and sponsors, and Darcy’s advice for making the most of both of them.</p>\n<p>[40.25] Darcy’s reflections on why women should dive into supply chain, and why they’re so well-suited to the industry.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“There was a study that actually said, statistically, women are better suited to supply chain – and it had to do with empathy.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[43.12] Darcy’s advice for girls and women looking to follow in her footsteps.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>RESOURCES AND LINKS MENTIONED:</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can connect with Darcy over on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dmacclaren/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">LinkedIn</a>.</p>\n<p>If you enjoyed this episode and want to hear from another incredible woman from SAP, check out <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/episode283-asian-discrimination/\">283: Blended – The Rise of Asian Discrimination </a>featuring Gale, Director of Global Influencer Marketing at the leading brand.</p>\n<p>Check out our other podcasts <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/podcast/\">HERE</a>.</p>\n",

This is a topic that is still very taboo. But, as with most things in life, it’s not black and white. Not all addicts are the same, and not everyone is addicted to alcohol or drugs. Our rapidly evolving culture has seen the rise of addiction to things like shopping, social media and even work, but our attitudes to addiction are still very much based in the past. And, around a very certain type of addict – the one I’m sure we’re all used to seeing meet a terrible fate in film and TV.</p>\n<p>And this kind of thing always worries me, because none of our conversations around DEI can move forward if we’re still holding on to stereotypes and judgments. Things are moving forward for women, people of color, the LGBTQIA+ community – it’s time to do the same for all those struggling with, or supporting loved ones who are struggling with, addiction.</p>\n<p>Today, our guests will be sharing their experiences of addiction; the power of nature in aiding recovery; loss and grief; tackling addiction in the workplace; and advice on how we can support those struggling, at work and in our communities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>IN THIS EPISODE WE DISCUSS:</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>[01.15] Introductions to our Blended panelists.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Angie – Founder of Siblinghood of Recovery Podcast</li>\n<li>Ariel – Herbalist &amp; Intuitive Healer</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[03.41] The group reflect on what addiction really is, and share their personal experiences, of struggling with addiction themselves and of supporting others.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“It really isn’t down to one specific thing or specific challenge, it’s a result of a lot of things.”  Angie</p></blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Lack of control</li>\n<li>Link to trauma</li>\n<li>Genetics</li>\n<li>Intergenerational trauma</li>\n<li>Mental ill health</li>\n<li>Blame, shame and judgment</li>\n<li>Self-worth</li>\n<li>Compassion and forgiveness</li>\n<li>Self-medication</li>\n<li>Loving the person, not the addict</li>\n<li>Being ill-equipped to support others</li>\n<li>Trying to find safety and coping mechanisms in unsafe outlets</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“I grew up in a family of addicts… and through coping and dealing with trauma I, at a young age, got into drugs and drinking.” Ariel</p></blockquote>\n<p>[25.09] The panel discusses the power of nature in aiding recovery and share their different recovery journeys.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Replacing dopamine</li>\n<li>Learning to trust your instincts</li>\n<li>Getting active</li>\n<li>Releasing trauma and stress from the body</li>\n<li>Empowerment</li>\n<li>People telling you who you are</li>\n<li>Expectations and limiting beliefs</li>\n<li>Re-writing your story</li>\n<li>Dysregulated nervous systems</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“Nature provides in every single way – it’s not just the biological, it’s the spiritual.” Ariel</p></blockquote>\n<p>[34.22] The group discusses what recovery looks like, tackling addiction in the workplace, and what companies can do to provide support and change mindsets when it comes to addiction.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I would challenge some companies to start using the phrase ‘sober curious’.” Angie</p></blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Holding space for people and creating conversations</li>\n<li>Education</li>\n<li>Accountability</li>\n<li>Support and allyship</li>\n<li>Culture of drinking</li>\n<li>Changing industry events</li>\n<li>Speak from the heart, not the ego</li>\n<li>Never give advice or opinions</li>\n<li>Offer professional resources</li>\n<li>Outsourcing and liability</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“The HR industry has to figure this one out, because there are so many legalities of ‘how deeply do you get involved in an employee’s personal life?&#8217; ” Angie</p></blockquote>\n<p>[54.03] The panel reflects on the loss that often comes hand in hand with addiction, and how best to support people.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Forgiveness</li>\n<li>Grief</li>\n<li>Build your own community</li>\n<li>Support networks</li>\n<li>Normalize words and conversations</li>\n<li>Boundaries</li>\n<li>Triggers</li>\n<li>Respect</li>\n<li>Meet people where they are</li>\n<li>Open-minded</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[1.07.02] The group sum up their thoughts from today’s discussion.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“When it comes to addiction, we can put ourselves on a pedestal. ‘Oh we don’t do that.’ There’s that stigma that comes with addiction. And once we take ourselves off that pedestal, we realize those people aren’t different to us, that we can help and support them and they have a place in this world.” Ariel</p></blockquote>\n<h2><strong>RESOURCES AND LINKS MENTIONED:</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can connect with <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ariel_andresen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ariel</a> on Instagram, or find out more about Angie&#8217;s podcast <a href=\"https://www.siblinghoodofrecovery.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Siblinghood of Recovery</a> over on her website, or on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/siblinghoodofrecovery/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Instagram</a>.</p>\n<p>If you enjoyed this podcast, why not check out <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/episode252/\">252: Blended – Hiding in Plain Sight: The Reality of Workplace Discrimination</a> or <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/158-blended-story-of-my-life/\">158: Blended – Story of my Life</a>.</p>\n<p>Check out our other podcasts <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/podcast\">HERE</a>.</p>\n",

I was an intern… I had the magic touch right away with pitching media… and it was gratifying from that point on!”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[09.55] How a challenging work climate led Jolene to take an internship and discover a passion for technology.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I took an internship… but I got into it really quickly, because it was a challenge…. It was different to representing a consumer brand.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[13.29] Jolene’s move to Blue Yonder, how she came to embrace supply chain, and the power of building a social media network.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“What surprised me the most was how many people in my network, that I’d developed and grown… were in supply chain.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[20.35] Jolene’s highlights and successes from her time at Blue Yonder, and what she learned along the way.</p>\n<p>[24.32] Jolene’s previous role as marketing lead for Blue Yonder’s Diversity, Inclusion, Value and Equality Council: what she loved about it, why it was so important, and her tips for anybody looking to implement something similar in their own workplace.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“You don’t have to jump on the bandwagon if you don’t have a perspective, because you’ll just look like you’re checking a box.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>[28.30] Jolene discusses the lack of Women In Supply Chain™ leadership roles, and how to open up opportunities.</p>\n<p>[32.07] Why Jolene is so passionate about women championing each other, and how we can tackle mentorship and woman-to-woman relationships in a competitive and male-dominated environment.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“It’s 2022, why do we still need these types of awareness opportunities?

Tokenism is a relatively new idea – the term was only coined in the late 70’s – but we are hearing it more and more as the conversations around diversity and inclusion grow. And, when issues like this arise, that can potentially derail the really good DEI work that so many people are doing, we have a responsibility to address it and get it out in the open – which is one of our favorite things to do on Blended!</p>\n<p>Today, our guests will be exploring exactly what tokenism means; sharing their personal experiences; and discussing how we can start to tackle tokenism in the workplace.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>IN THIS EPISODE WE DISCUSS:</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>[00.54] Introductions to our Blended panelists.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gennifer – Founder/Executive Director at TransNewYork</li>\n<li>Clarecia – Chief Consultant at Global Compass Consulting Services Inc</li>\n<li>Breanne – Growth Coordinator at Let&#8217;s Talk Supply Chain™</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[06.20] The group discusses tokenism: what it means to them, and how it fits into diversity, equity and inclusion.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Being reactive vs proactive</li>\n<li>Issues with awareness days</li>\n<li>Box ticking</li>\n<li>What’s visible to the public vs what’s behind closed doors</li>\n<li>Having a seat at the table, but not a voice</li>\n<li>Accountability</li>\n<li>What are businesses actually doing to change hearts and minds, and help educate?</li>\n<li>Conflicts of interest</li>\n<li>Incorporating DEI into value systems and business norms, not one-offs</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“Tokenism is being included but not being included – it’s about being included in spaces, only because someone wants to tick a box.” Clarecia</p></blockquote>\n<p>[27.37] The group share their personal experiences of tokenism, and the impact those experiences had on both themselves and their communities.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Differences between generations</li>\n<li>Leadership</li>\n<li>The makeup of C Suite</li>\n<li>Commitment to change</li>\n<li>Listening to understand</li>\n<li>Appreciating others&#8217; experiences, not just treating them as a problem to be solved</li>\n<li>Sense of belonging</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>“It’s hard to break down those walls of, not only people using tokenism on me, but me not wanting to feel like I’m projecting tokenism onto somebody else.” Gennifer</p></blockquote>\n<p>[51.03] The panel summarizes their ideas on how organizations can successfully avoid tokenism, and they sum up their thoughts from today’s discussion.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I would love to see more accountability, more showcasing year round; understanding that everyone, whether it’s for pride or black history month, it’s not a box that everyone fits into… you need to be thinking about everyone as an individual and as unique.” Breanne</p></blockquote>\n<h2><strong>RESOURCES AND LINKS MENTIONED:</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can connect with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-gennifer-herley-phd-8aa954b6/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-schema-attribute=\"\">Gennifer</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/iamClareciaChristie/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-schema-attribute=\"\">Clarecia</a> on Instagram.

Now this is something that many of us, outside of the Asian community, had probably not thought too much about. But when the pandemic hit, putting in some cases a potentially negative light on China, the world saw an eruption of hate and anger towards Asian people that was quite shocking to see, and which has really taken its toll on communities worldwide.</p>\n<p>Today, our guests will be exploring exactly what Asian discrimination means and why it happens; sharing their personal experiences; taking a closer look at some of the new initiatives being put into place across America; and discussing how we can start to tackle the issue of Asian discrimination and discrimination in the workplace.</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2><strong>IN THIS EPISODE WE DISCUSS:</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>[00.48] Introductions to our Blended panelists.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sharon – Inventory Optimization Consultant</li>\n<li>Naomi – Senior Manager for Supply Chain Solutions Marketing at Anaplan</li>\n<li>Gale – Director of Global Influencer Marketing at SAP</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[04.34] The group discusses Asian hate, the current surge as a direct result of the pandemic, as well as other examples throughout history, and its impact.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Education and mindset go hand in hand.
