    "content": "<p>Women In Supply Chain™ leadership are shaking up a male-dominated industry that is primed for meaningful change. Tariffs. Wars. Climate events. This industry is disruptive; we need fresh perspectives and diversity of thought from leaders with different backgrounds to respond to an industry that is evolving every week.</p>\r\n<p>Because the supply chain challenges of the 2020s have changed the supply chain game—possibly forever —and because geopolitical tensions are currently quickly reshaping global supply chains and industries in historic ways. Trade disputes, sanctions, and regional conflicts are forcing business leaders to rethink where and <em>how</em> they source materials. Tariff negotiations continue between the U.S. and other nations, resulting in unstoppable change.</p>\r\n<p>Now, energy and critical material supplies are disrupted by global instability. The war in Ukraine continues to impact the flow of energy resources like natural gas and oil across Europe, while the constantly changing conflict in the Middle East is adding new layers of complexity around shipping routes and fuel prices. Meanwhile, competition for access to rare-earth minerals critical to semiconductors, batteries, and renewable technologies has intensified. Nations are increasingly positioning these types of resources as strategic assets, prompting export controls and new investments in domestic mining and processing capabilities for long-term supply security.</p>\r\n<p>And businesses are being forced to balance resilience and efficiency. The “just-in-time” supply chain strategies that have been fading over the past few years are being replaced by “just-in-case” strategies that prioritize risk management, resilience, and flexibility. Companies are investing in nearshoring, supply chain technologies, and stronger partnerships with regional suppliers. This sea change can protect and bolster operations from geopolitical shocks, but often entails higher costs and slower transitions. Agility and adaptability are becoming as valuable as cost savings—fundamentally redefining what it means to be and remain competitive in global trade.</p>\r\n<p>At Let’s Talk Supply Chain, our Women In Supply Chain™ series represents a powerful movement that we see across the logistics and manufacturing industries. There’s a mounting presence of Women In Supply Chain™, many bringing novel solutions along with them. Our Let’s Talk Supply Chain blog and podcast series showcase the importance of greater gender diversity and elevating voices from different backgrounds. And this month’s featured leader is passionate about that allyship.</p>\r\n<p>This month, we are delighted to feature <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/reetu-bhargava/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Reetu Bhargava</a> ,  She is the Director of Operations at TopMont School where she manages end-to-end supply chain and operational processes and oversees procurement, vendor management, inventory planning, logistics, and facility management.</p>\r\n<p>Reetu has amassed a wealth of knowledge over her career and through academic achievements. She boasts a degree from the Management Development Institute in Gurgaon—focused on administration, logistics, materials, and supply chain management, a degree from Forest Research Institute, studies at Cambrian Hall, and more.</p>\r\n<p>Her career spans over 17 years—building and leveraging experience in operational system implementations that streamline procurement cycles, logistics networks, inventory management, and facility operations. She’s adept at leading cross-functional teams, managing vendors and stakeholders, and driving process excellence for organizational growth and cost optimization.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.7em; font-weight: bold;\">1. How did your supply chain journey start?</span></p>\r\n<p>I began my journey with a decade of dedicated service in the Indian Air Force, following a year of rigorous training. There, I led critical logistics and supply chain operations under high-pressure environments—laying a strong foundation in planning, coordination, leadership, and operational excellence. After completing a six-month business management course from a renowned institute, I began applying to corporate roles and was soon offered a Head of Supply Chain position, reporting directly to the CEO—an exciting opportunity aligned with my experience and aspirations.</p>\r\n<p>However, stepping into a senior leadership role in a male-dominated environment brought unexpected challenges. Resistance, office politics, and subtle exclusion reminded me that the role may have been unofficially reserved for someone else. My goal was never to outshine anyone, but to contribute sincerely, work with integrity, and help drive meaningful results for the organization. When I realized the environment wouldn’t allow me to function with dignity and purpose, I made the difficult decision to walk away. Though I briefly considered transitioning into HR or Admin—roles more &#8220;acceptable&#8221; for women—I soon recognized that supply chain is not just my profession, it&#8217;s my passion.</p>\r\n<p>While exploring new opportunities, especially in aviation, I struggled due to limited networks outside the military. I turned this period into one of growth—pursuing certifications, learning about AI in supply chains, networking, and immersing myself in leadership literature. Thought leaders like Jack Ma, Jim Rohn, Simon Sinek, Eckhart Tolle, and John Maxwell became my virtual mentors, helping me strengthen my mindset and rebuild my confidence.</p>\r\n<p>During this phase, I embraced entrepreneurship. I founded TopMont, a Montessori preschool, and launched Bliss Corridor, a mental wellness platform. At TopMont, I manage complete supply chain and operations—overseeing procurement, logistics, vendor, and parent relations—while creating meaningful employment opportunities for women. This journey enhanced my strategic decision-making and cross-functional leadership skills; however, my dream of leading large-scale supply chains remains as strong as ever.</p>\r\n<p>A turning point came when I discovered Sarah and the <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/\">Let’s Talk Supply Chain</a><a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/\"> community</a>. Listening to the Women In Supply Chain™ series—especially Christine’s episode—was a moment of realization: I wasn’t alone. If they could rise and lead, so could I.</p>\r\n<p>Today, I’m actively seeking to return to the corporate supply chain domain with renewed clarity and strength. I bring a unique blend of military precision, entrepreneurial agility, and strong leadership. My journey has been filled with lessons, resilience, and purpose—and I’m ready to lead with even greater impact in the years to come.</p>\r\n<h2>2. How have mentors played a role in your growth as a woman in supply chain?</h2>\r\n<p>While I didn’t have a formal mentor early in my career, I was deeply influenced by the leadership I observed within my organization. As I transitioned into the corporate world, I found guidance in the journeys of visionary leaders like Jeff Bezos, Jack Ma, Elon Musk, and Tim Cook—pioneers who transformed global supply chains through innovation, resilience, and strategic foresight. I also drew immense inspiration from supply chain leaders like Sarah Barnes-Humphrey and Christine Barnhart, whose voices champion inclusion and drive meaningful change in the industry. Their stories have helped shape my mindset, strengthen my leadership values, and reinforce the belief that with clarity and courage, anything is possible.</p>\r\n<h2>3. What’s your experience working in a male-dominated industry?</h2>\r\n<p>Working in the supply chain domain has been both challenging and eye-opening—helping me uncover a potential I hadn’t fully recognized. In the military, the uniform brought structure and authority, making it easier to lead teams and earn respect. Transitioning to the corporate world, however, was a different battlefield—one where, without the uniform, I had to re-establish my leadership in environments where women in senior supply chain roles are still not widely accepted. The unspoken biases and subtle resistance were tough, but they also strengthened my resilience and deepened my resolve to lead with authenticity and purpose.</p>\r\n<h2>4. When did you find your voice in your career?</h2>\r\n<p> I found my voice gradually, but one defining moment brought it all together. During my military tenure, I was entrusted with overseeing the complete logistics arrangements for an international exercise—within a highly compressed timeline. The success of that mission, along with the trust placed in me by both seniors and subordinates, helped me truly recognize the strength of decisive leadership, problem-solving, and strategic planning. That experience was my turning point—like a butterfly emerging from its cocoon, I discovered my confidence and clarity. I knew then that I could lead complex, multi-faceted supply chain operations with purpose and precision.</p>\r\n<h2>5. What advice do you have for Women In Supply Chain™ and others looking to start a career in the industry?</h2>\r\n<p>My advice to girls and women is <em>have unwavering faith in yourself</em>—your potential, your capabilities, and your worth—because strength, clarity, and leadership are not defined by gender. Don’t wait for the perfect moment; begin where you are now, with what you have, and commit to lifelong learning. Challenges will come, but within every obstacle lies an opportunity and a valuable lesson. Along the way, remember to support and uplift one another. Embrace your journey with confidence, stay resilient, and lead with bold courage and unwavering determination. The world needs more women who are ready to shape the future with purpose, strength, and vision—especially in the dynamic and ever-evolving field of supply chain.</p>\r\n<h2>6. Who do you admire in and outside of the supply chain?</h2>\r\n<p>I deeply admire J.R.D. Tata and Ratan Tata for their values-driven leadership and unwavering commitment to building with purpose and integrity. Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos inspire me with their bold innovation and transformative impact on global supply chains. Within the industry, leaders like Sarah Barnes-Humphrey, Christine Barnhart, and Toma Matutyte have shown how women can lead with strength, empathy, and measurable influence.</p>\r\n<h2>7. What have you learned on your supply chain journey so far and what’s next?</h2>\r\n<p>On my journey so far, I’ve learned that nothing is impossible when one is determined to achieve a goal. With clear and kind intentions, I’ve seen how the right people and opportunities align to support that pursuit. I’ve discovered that my potential is limitless when fueled by challenges, purpose, and discipline. I work with clarity and invest time in meticulous planning, ensuring execution is seamless and effective. My military background is a core strength—it has sharpened my ability to adapt swiftly, lead decisively, and deliver with precision, all of which are vital in today’s evolving supply chains. Looking ahead, I aim to enhance operational efficiency and drive sustainability across global supply networks.</p>\r\n<h2>8. What does this Women In Supply Chain™ feature mean to you?</h2>\r\n<p>Being featured in the Women In Supply Chain™ series is a proud and meaningful milestone in my journey. This platform not only gives identity to supply chain professionals but also honors every contribution that drives the industry forward. It has allowed me to reflect on my experiences and lessons learned, while reigniting my passion to keep progressing.

    "content": "<p>Women In Supply Chain™ leadership are transforming the industry when it’s needed most during endless disruptions that have only grown over the last year. Traditional approaches don’t apply anymore, and that means that fresh perspectives and diversity in thought from leaders with different backgrounds with unique life experiences are increasingly important.</p>\r\n<p>More and more consumers are paying attention to where their purchases originate—and it’s changing the way companies do business. With social media, constant headlines online, and blogs and podcasts dedicated to the topic,  consumers know more about the supply chain journeys behind their favorite brands than ever before. And, they’re asking tougher questions: <em>How were these materials sourced? What’s the carbon footprint of getting it to my doorstep? Were the workers who made it treated fairly?</em> Ongoing climate events and increasing exposure to labor conditions across the globe are creating a drumbeat of dialogues online and off about ethical production, sustainability, and finding brands aligned with consumer values.</p>\r\n<p>Generational change and a growing focus on sustainability and corporate responsibility are motivating consumers to find more sustainably and ethically produced and sourced goods. Even as cost-of-living pressures grow across nations, some shoppers are still willing to spend almost 10% more on average for sustainably produced or sourced goods. A contributing factor? <a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/news-room/press-releases/2024/pwc-2024-voice-of-consumer-survey.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Almost nine in ten consumers</a> report experiencing climate-change disruptions in their daily lives.</p>\r\n<p> Shoppers want proof that their purchases are made responsibly. In response, companies are mapping out their supply chains, investing in greener logistics, and publishing detailed sustainability reports to show progress. Labels like “carbon neutral” or “ethically sourced” are now signals of trust as more people shop with greater intention. Sustainable supply chains are quickly becoming the new standard, turning conscious consumption from a trend into a movement.</p>\r\n<p>Many companies are working to respond, but are still figuring out how to turn big promises into real progress. Most major brands have some kind of ESG or sustainability program in place, but putting those goals into action is the toughest part. It takes time, money, and meaningful progress. Still, companies are pushing forward—testing new green technologies, switching to renewable energy, and working with suppliers to make their operations more transparent. Business leaders see that corporate social responsibility is no longer just about doing the right thing—it’s about staying relevant, resilient, and trusted in a market with more engaged and educated consumers.</p>\r\n<p>At Let’s Talk Supply Chain, our Women In Supply Chain™ series is more than a call to action; it’s a movement. There’s a growing presence of Women In Supply Chain™ who see and approach things differently, with new approaches and solutions. Our Let’s Talk Supply Chain <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/women-in-supply-chain/\">Women In Supply Chain™ program</a>, blog, and podcast series showcase the importance of greater gender representation. This month’s featured leader knows all about the importance of allyship in lifting women’s voices and the importance of corporate social responsibility programs and true solutions for companies looking to limit their carbon footprint.</p>\r\n<p>This month, we are honored to highlight <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/manoela-sehbe-peixoto/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Manoela Peixoto</a>, the Corporate Sustainability Manager for <a href=\"https://apexglobe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Apex Logistics International</a>. She has over 15 years of experience in navigating the complexities of supply chain operations, pricing strategies, and now, environmental impact. Manoela boasts a master’s degree from the Universitat de Barcelona and a certificate in project management from the University of Washington. She is driven by connecting with people, understanding the complexity of global operations, and building solutions that make logistics more sustainable.</p>\r\n<h2>1. How did your supply chain journey start?</h2>\r\n<p>My passion for Supply Chain and Logistics started early. I earned both my bachelor&#8217;s and master’s degrees in International Business, and I was <em>that friend</em> who got excited about containers on the highway and couldn’t wait to explain incoterms. That curiosity led me to roles in import/export operations and procurement and pricing across Brazil, Spain, and the United States. I have to confess that it&#8217;s even showing off on my 4-year-old daughter. Every time she gets a new toy, she says, “This toy traveled a looong way to me!&#8221; Today, I lead the Sustainability Program at <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/apex-logistics-international/?\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Apex Logistics International</a>, focused on how we can help our clients move goods more responsibly.</p>\r\n<h2>2. How have mentors played a role in your growth as a woman in supply chain?</h2>\r\n<p>I’ve had great mentors throughout my career. Not formally, but through meaningful relationships. I believe that if you ask questions and listen with curiosity, you can learn so much. Early in my career, I had a boss who trusted my judgment and gave me room to learn on the job. Our conversations about decision-making taught me to trust my instincts, a lesson I carry with me to this day. In a previous role, I had another informal mentor who later hired me. She cared deeply about both her work ethics and her team, and showed me that we can be the kind of leaders we aspire to become.</p>\r\n<h2>3. What’s your experience working in a male-dominated industry?</h2>\r\n<p>Having worked in supply chain and logistics across multiple countries, my experience as a woman has been surprisingly positive. It hasn&#8217;t been perfect, but I’ve been fortunate to have supportive colleagues, managers, and allies along the way. One of the biggest lessons I’ve learned, and honestly, continue to work on, is to trust myself and speak up. Women often downplay our achievements, but it’s so important to learn how to confidently own and communicate them.</p>\r\n<h2>4. When did you find your voice in your career?</h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Cambria',serif;\">Many experiences have shaped who I am and how I lead today. The first pivotal moment was when I led a team of young professionals. I was in my late twenties myself, and I realized how much influence a leader can have not just on someone’s career, but on their life. Talking with them about their goals and growth made me understand the kind of leader I wanted to be: one who leads with empathy, curiosity, and genuine care.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Cambria',serif;\"> The second has been in my current role, where I’ve found my voice through collaboration with customers, suppliers, and across the entire ecosystem of supply chain sustainability.  Working together to find innovative, low-carbon solutions has shown me the power of shared purpose and collective change.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Cambria',serif;\"> And finally, becoming a mom transformed my perspective. It made me value my time and commit to setting an example for my daughters. I want them to grow up knowing that work matters, and that they can become anything they choose, as long as they do it with integrity and commitment.</span></p>\r\n<h2>5. What advice do you have for Women In Supply Chain™ and others looking to start a career in the industry?</h2>\r\n<p>My advice for Women In Supply Chain™ is to know your strengths and not be afraid to show them. In this field, you have to be adaptable and ready to pivot quickly. Build relationships, grow your network, and always think about how things can be done better. Don’t be afraid of change, as technology is constantly evolving, and we should use it to our advantage.</p>\r\n<p>And to any women who are immigrants, please know that your background is not a barrier—it&#8217;s your strength. We bring care, empathy, and strong ethics to our work. And that matters. Stay curious, trust your voice, and don’t be afraid to take up space. You have every right to be here, and the industry needs what you bring.</p>\r\n<h2>6. Who do you admire in and outside of the supply chain?</h2>\r\n<p>It’s hard to name just one person because I’ve been fortunate to work with so many people I admire. I am inspired by people who not only care about their work but also about the people around them.</p>\r\n<p>Outside of the industry, I’ve been blessed with an incredible family. My parents are some of the hardest-working people I know. I can go all the way to my great-grandfather, who immigrated from Lebanon to Brazil, worked his way up&#8230; and taught our family that “a day without work is a lost day”. His journey still inspires me every day.</p>\r\n<h2>7. What have you learned on your supply chain journey so far and what’s next?</h2>\r\n<p>So far, I’ve learned that I’m more resilient and adaptable than I ever gave myself credit for and grown to trust my instincts, speak up, and lead with empathy.</p>\r\n<p>Looking ahead, I’m excited to keep exploring how we can move goods more responsibly. Open to new technologies that support greener transportation, such as EVs and renewable fuels. I want to stay curious, and ready to do business in a different way, because that’s what the future of supply chain is.</p>\r\n<p>I’m working towards expanding my individual impact in Sustainability: continuing to push for better and cleaner solutions in logistics, and exploring innovative ways to reduce our environmental footprint.</p>\r\n<p>I continue to invest in my personal growth. With young kids, it&#8217;s so hard to find the time, but I&#8217;d like to continue to build my confidence as a leader and learn new skills in the sustainability space.</p>\r\n<p>And lastly, I am dedicating to continuing to lift others up: I would love to mentor more, share more, and create space for others—especially women.</p>\r\n<h2>8. What does this Women In Supply Chain™ feature mean to you?</h2>\r\n<p>It&#8217;s a great honor to be featured in this series alongside so many incredible women, not only as a woman, but as an immigrant working in Supply Chain in the United States. I hope that by sharing my journey in supply chain, which started in Brazil, continued with my master’s in Barcelona, and brought me to the United States, I can inspire others who are forging their own path. Working and learning across different cultures has shaped how I see the world. In the end, it’s always about the people. This feature feels special.</p>\r\n<p><em>We hope our Women In Supply Chain™ blog series inspires readers to reimagine what’s possible, take action, and bring people from different backgrounds together for stronger and more meaningful collaboration.

    "content": "<p>Women In Supply Chain™ leadership are transforming the industry when it’s needed most during endless disruptions that have only exacerbated over the last year, rattled by climate change, geopolitical tensions, and an all-out tariff war. The same rinse-and-repeat approaches don’t apply anymore, and that means that fresh perspectives and diversity in thought are increasingly important.</p>\r\n<p>On the policy front, there may be some good news as we enter peak season. The U.S. doubled tariffs on imports from India to 50% at the end of August; however, there may be some relief on the way. The current administration may remove 25% of the penal tariffs after November 30th, with trade discussions ongoing. U.S. goods imported from India totaled around $87.3B last year, according to the <a href=\"https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/south-central-asia/india\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">United States Trade Representative (USTR)</a>. That’s a big chunk of the total bilateral trade between the U.S. and India at $128.9B. You might think of clothing goods made in India, but trade between the two countries goes far beyond that. Critical imports of goods from India include electronics and electric equipment, pharmaceutical products, precious stones and metals, machinery, and nuclear reactors and boilers.</p>\r\n<p>The United States and China are still in a temporary tariff truce, suspending steeper tariffs on Chinese goods until at least November 10th—spurring more companies to frontload shipments moving into the holiday season. The Trump administration has signaled that it may be amenable to extending the pause further as the nations work to negotiate. Ongoing trade negotiations between the U.S. and other countries bode well for global supply chains that have experienced historical disruptions over the past months.</p>\r\n<p>Market volatility underscores the importance of having a diverse range of thought in supply chain. It’s time to innovate and bring together new voices from different backgrounds with different perspectives and knowledge sets—including women’s. Because with the industry all but upended by the “new normal,” just 26% of Women In Supply Chain™ leadership is simply not enough.</p>\r\n<p>At Let’s Talk Supply Chain, our Women In Supply Chain™ series is more than a call to action; it’s a movement. There’s a growing workforce of Women In Supply Chain™ who see and approach things differently, and have new strategies and flavors of leadership. Our Let’s Talk Supply Chain <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/women-in-supply-chain/\">Women In Supply Chain™ program</a>, blog, and podcast series showcase the importance of greater gender representation. This month’s featured leader knows all about the importance of allyship in lifting women’s voices.</p>\r\n<p>We are proud to feature <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/smulberg/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Suki Mulberg Altamirano</a>, the Founder &amp; Principal of Lexington Public Relations. For over two decades, she’s crafted storytelling into bold campaigns to drive brand authority, visibility, and credibility, winning awards along the way. Lexington PR was hailed by the American Business Awards with its gold Communications/PR Agency Merit Award for 2024. She is a published author and earned a Bachelor of Science in Communications and Media Studies from New York University.</p>\r\n<h2>1. How did your supply chain journey start?</h2>\r\n<p>My journey began in New York City with my first role at LVMH, followed by in-house PR positions at Elizabeth Arden and Williams-Sonoma, where I honed my storytelling skills in lifestyle sectors. Fourteen years ago, I founded Lexington Public Relations, initially focusing on fashion, beauty, food, and lifestyle brands —a natural extension of my early career experience. The pivotal shift came through a VC firm’s introduction to portfolio clients across an array of new industries, including edtech, healthcare technology, and more.</p>\r\n<p>I almost hesitated because it felt so out of my wheelhouse, but that decision to embrace unfamiliar territory opened entirely new possibilities. Those clients led to an array of new industries, and one specifically was in material handling and supply chain.</p>\r\n<p>I suddenly found myself really enjoying working in sectors I&#8217;d never considered earlier in my career. That willingness to step outside my comfort zone snowballed into countless opportunities, and today our agency specializes in helping clients in tech, supply chain, material handling, energy, and automation tell their stories. This evolution has been as rewarding as it was surprising.</p>\r\n<h2>2. How have mentors played a role in your growth as a woman in supply chain?</h2>\r\n<p>For a long time, I thought I didn&#8217;t have a mentor. I’d always say no when asked this question because I had a traditional vision of mentorship as someone from my field who would have all the answers to guide my career decisions. But recently, I decided I’d been thinking about mentorship all wrong. Rather than a single mentor, communities of support have been key to my professional journey. I’ve had PR and marketing colleagues who understand our field’s struggles and help celebrate our wins. I also have mom and entrepreneurship networks, friends, and family who said “you can do it” when I doubted myself. These connections remind me why building your network is essential, and I’m grateful that now I mentor others through programs like the Buerk Center for Entrepreneurship and WE Lead (women’s entrepreneurship) at the University of Washington’s Foster School of Business. I get to both guide and learn alongside fellow entrepreneurs.</p>\r\n<h2>3. What’s your experience working in a male-dominated industry?</h2>\r\n<p>My early career was exclusively in female-dominated fields like beauty, fashion, and lifestyle, and if I&#8217;m being frank, there were plenty of challenges there too. When I transitioned into supply chain and material handling later in my career, I had an advantage that I already knew my craft, had seen a lot, and had developed the confidence that comes with experience. Entering this space as an established professional already made the transition smoother and allowed me to focus on the value I bring rather than having to prove that I belong. I’ve also been intentional about aligning with sharp women in the field and partnering with clients who genuinely support diverse viewpoints. I honestly don’t think a lot about myself as a woman in a historically male-dominated industry. I try just to be!</p>\r\n<h2>4. When did you find your voice in your career?</h2>\r\n<p>It came with age! My aha moment wasn’t that profound; it was to care less about what others thought. I’ve always had my voice (and plenty of strong opinions), but I wasn’t always confident in expressing them earlier in my career. I was also ridiculously uncomfortable promoting myself or my business. The irony is, I spent decades as a publicist convincing clients it was essential to build their profiles, all while keeping my own work firmly in the background. My take on this today is that staying invisible doesn’t serve anyone. Sharing your success and the value of your work isn’t about bragging; it’s essential to letting people know who you are, what you do, and why it matters. And if you’re in any client-facing business, you can’t survive without it.</p>\r\n<h2>5. What advice do you have for Women In Supply Chain™ and others looking to start a career in the industry?</h2>\r\n<p>Don&#8217;t let unfamiliar territory intimidate you. Your unique perspective and transferable skills are precisely what established industries need to evolve and grow. We can all benefit from thinking more broadly about the benefits and relevance of our skill sets. Trust your instincts, invest time in understanding your industry&#8217;s core challenges, and don&#8217;t be afraid to ask questions even when they might seem basic. I ask questions all the time about things I don&#8217;t understand—not understanding something doesn&#8217;t mean you aren’t qualified. Remember that expertise is built through curiosity and commitment, not just credentials. Most importantly, find your champions within the industry. There are more allies than you might expect, and they might not always be where you were looking.</p>\r\n<h2>6. Who do you admire in and outside of the supply chain?</h2>\r\n<p>The people I most admire are the ones who just own it. They own their strengths and their weaknesses, they&#8217;re real about things, and they&#8217;re transparent. It takes guts to own what you’re not great at and then move forward anyway. When you share vulnerability, people are more likely to want to champion your honesty. In life or business, this is important. As an entrepreneur, you also need to accept when something isn’t working. Don’t become paralyzed, but rather pivot to find your success. It’s easier said than done!</p>\r\n<h2>7. What have you learned on your supply chain journey so far and what’s next?</h2>\r\n<p>My journey so far has taught me that adaptability and resilience are my greatest strengths. I excel at working with different people and jumping into different work landscapes. Living everywhere from NYC to rural Kentucky, Louisville, Nashville, San Francisco, and Seattle has played a role.</p>\r\n<p>I love the storytelling aspect of PR and the psychology, thinking about how your message will be perceived, and being able to read the room and sense what resonates with different audiences. I’ve also learned that when someone looks like they have it all together, that’s usually resilience in action.</p>\r\n<p>Looking ahead, the future is about staying on the path I&#8217;m on, continuing to grow Lexington PR&#8217;s impact while maintaining the balance and perspective that my experiences have given me. I’d love to create videos using AI tools and have a good understanding of how PR strategies need to evolve to optimize AI search results. AI feels like the next frontier in our industry. I also hope I’ve kept up owning my voice and not just being a voice for clients. That I’ve committed to taking the recommendations I tell clients about sharing their views, being active across social channels, and offering their perspective.</p>\r\n<h2>8. What does this Women In Supply Chain™ feature mean to you?</h2>\r\n<p>This feature represents the journey I’ve been on since my early days in beauty and lifestyle PR. When I founded Lexington Public Relations 14 years ago, I never imagined I&#8217;d become passionate about sectors like material handling, tech, logistics, energy, and supply chain management. This recognition isn’t really about my personal journey, but rather highlights how women can successfully pivot and thrive across various industries. It&#8217;s meaningful to be recognized alongside other women who are shaping the future of our field, and I hope my story inspires others to embrace unexpected career paths.</p>\r\n<p><em>We hope our Women In Supply Chain™ blog series inspires readers to reimagine what’s possible, take action, and bring people from different backgrounds together for stronger and more meaningful collaboration.

And Women In Supply Chain™ leadership are transforming the industry when it’s needed most, during endless disruptions that have only exacerbated over the last year, rattled by climate change, geopolitical tensions, and an all-out tariff war. The same rinse-and-repeat approaches don’t apply anymore, and that means that fresh perspectives and diversity in thought are increasingly important.</p>\r\n<p>The latest negotiated “reciprocal” tariffs went into effect on August 7th. The administration first announced the tariff plans in April to give U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials time to collect taxes. Tariffs on Canadian goods will jump from 25% to 35% unless covered under the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement; however, behind-the-scenes negotiations are ongoing. Goods from Mexico received a reprieve from the 25% tariff rate when U.S. and Mexican officials announced a 90-day extension to negotiate a long-term trade deal on July 31st. Those are big numbers to consider, with Mexico ranking as the top U.S. trade partner in June of 2025 at $73B followed by Canada at $58B. Meanwhile, at the start of August, the president shared his plans to raise tariffs on pharmaceutical imports into the U.S., eventually reaching up to 250%.</p>\r\n<p>Now is the time to innovate and bring together new voices from different backgrounds with different perspectives and knowledge sets—including women’s. Because with the industry all but upended by the “new normal,” 26% of Women In Supply Chain™ leadership is simply not enough. And, while emotional intelligence is not inherently gendered, <a href=\"http://nextupleader.com/blog/the-science-of-success-how-women-leaders-with-high-eq-win\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">research suggests</a> that women frequently score higher on measures of empathy and interpersonal sensitivity, huge factors in leading in a modern and disruptive supply chain space.</p>\r\n<p>And at Let’s Talk Supply Chain, we are making our Women In Supply Chain™ series more than a call to action; it’s a movement.

Our Let’s Talk Supply Chain <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/women-in-supply-chain/\">Women In Supply Chain™ program</a>, blog, and podcast series showcase the importance of greater gender representation. This month’s featured leader is the embodiment of the importance of leading through kindness and empathy.</p>\r\n<p>We are proud to feature <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/elenagalbally/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Elena Galbally</a>. Elena is a senior robotics engineer at Mytra, building robotics and AI-driven solutions to empower resilient, modular, and reconfigurable material flow and storage. She boasts both a PHD in Mechanical Engineering, Robotics and a Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering from Stanford University. She also graduated from the University of Maryland with a Bachelor’s in Bioengineering after first attending the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.</p>\r\n<h2>1. How did your supply chain journey start?</h2>\r\n<p>I grew up in Spain and completed my first three years of undergraduate studies in Biomedical Engineering at Universidad Carlos III in Madrid. In my senior year, I studied at the University of Maryland as an exchange student and worked on a new stroke rehabilitation device as part of my capstone project. I also took an assistive robotics class that motivated me to learn more and look for an internship in the field. That&#8217;s how I ended up in Pensacola (FL) at IHMC&#8217;s (Institute for Human and Machine Cognition) Robot Lab. I recently graduated with a PhD in robotics from the Stanford Robotics Lab and now work as a robotics engineer at Mytra.</p>\r\n<h2>2. How have mentors played a role in your growth as a woman in supply chain?</h2>\r\n<p>I’ve been lucky to have several informal mentors throughout my journey—colleagues and friends who shared advice and encouragement along the way. Mentors come in all shapes and forms, from any background and gender. Sylvain Bertrand stands out; a controls engineer lead at IHMC. He patiently taught me new concepts and encouraged my curiosity. His unconventional path—from working with a French circus to earning a PhD—reminded me that there’s no single route to success and inspired me to pursue my PhD in Mechanical Engineering.</p>\r\n<h2>3. What’s your experience working in a male-dominated industry?</h2>\r\n<p>Throughout my education and career, I’ve been a minority, sometimes even working in a lab as the only female scientist of 24 people. It’s easy to have impostor syndrome in a setting like this, but I consistently reminded myself that I earned this opportunity and deserved to be here. Luckily, even as a minority, the communities I’ve entered are always supportive and respectful.</p>\r\n<h2>4. When did you find your voice in your career?</h2>\r\n<p>There wasn’t a single epiphany, but there have been several moments that gave me clarity and confidence. Getting the call that I’d been accepted to Stanford with a fellowship—after almost not applying—was one. Defending my thesis and finding a workplace like Mytra, where I feel challenged and supported, were others. Participating in a Women in Science coffee talk with a European research agency also stands out. I initially thought, <em>“Why me?”</em> but surprised myself with how much I had to share and how well it was received.</p>\r\n<h2>5. What advice do you have for Women In Supply Chain™ and others looking to start a career in the industry?</h2>\r\n<p>Explore the industries and topics that spark your interest, even if the path forward feels uncertain. If you follow your passions at first, exploring and maybe even failing, this will lead you to where you are meant to be. This hands-on experience will help build your confidence and connect you with the people who will help shape your career along the way. Not every opportunity has to be perfect, but if you give it your all, it can lead you to the next one.</p>\r\n<h2>6. Who do you admire in and outside of the supply chain?</h2>\r\n<p>I’d have to say my mom. My upbringing played a huge role in where I am today, and I’m incredibly grateful for that. I played with the same trucks and trains as my three brothers and was encouraged to explore science and technology just like them. Watching my mom balance four kids with a career in academia was incredibly inspiring—her passion for science definitely rubbed off on me.</p>\r\n<h2>7. What have you learned on your supply chain journey so far and what’s next?</h2>\r\n<p>I’ve learned that what really energizes me are forward-looking R&amp;D projects, cross-functional work, prototyping and communicating new ideas, and finding ways to help people grow and build a positive team culture. I’ve also learned that progress isn’t always linear, and in those moments of doubt, it’s important to believe in your team, your project, and yourself. Keep showing up, and the results may surprise you.</p>\r\n<p>In the future, I hope to continue carving out more time to grow as a mentor, take on new challenges even when I don’t feel entirely ready, and contribute to my team not only through technical work but by staying grounded, kind, and supportive through high-pressure moments.</p>\r\n<h2>8. What does this Women In Supply Chain™ feature mean to you?</h2>\r\n<p>It’s an honor to be featured among so many talented and driven women. Representation matters, and I hope sharing my story helps others see the many paths into tech and robotics—even ones that aren’t linear or perfectly planned out. The more we highlight diverse voices in this space, the more inclusive and innovative our industry becomes.</p>\r\n<h4> </h4>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Women In Supply Chain™: Empowering Your Journey at Every Career Stage</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Whether you&#8217;re just starting or leading at the highest levels, our Women In Supply Chain™ membership programs are designed to support you in every career phase.

    "content": "<p>Women in leadership are making a powerful impact on the supply chain industry. With fresh perspectives and a collaborative mindset, Women In Supply Chain™ are modernizing how supply chains operate. They focus on more than just efficiency and cost-savings—bringing emotional intelligence, communication savvy, and a deep commitment to building strong, resilient teams. That people-first approach can change everything, especially in a space that relies so heavily on relationships, coordination, and long-term trust to navigate ongoing disruption.</p>\r\n<p>The biggest shifts we’re seeing are centered around agility and innovation. Women in leadership roles are often more flexible and stronger in creative problem-solving—exactly what’s needed in an unpredictable global environment. From navigating tariffs and geopolitical uncertainty to managing disruptions like port congestion or raw material shortages, these women leaders are leaning into transparency and collaboration. They don’t hold back; they ask the tough questions, challenge the status quo, and push for smarter tools that make supply chains more responsive.</p>\r\n<p>And it’s not just about what’s happening at one business. Women In Supply Chain™ leadership are also building stronger relationships with suppliers and customers, investing in sustainability, and advocating for more inclusive and ethical practices. They&#8217;re changing the face of the industry—showing that leading with empathy and strength isn’t just possible, it’s incredibly effective. As more companies recognize the value of diverse leadership, we’re seeing supply chains become more adaptable, connected, and ready for whatever comes next.</p>\r\n<p>And at Let’s Talk Supply Chain, we think this is more than a trend; it’s a movement. There’s a growing workforce of Women In Supply Chain™ who see and approach things differently, bringing fresh perspectives and out-of-the-box solutions. Our Let’s Talk Supply Chain <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/women-in-supply-chain/\">Women In Supply Chain™ program</a>, blog, and podcast series showcase the importance of greater gender representation.</p>\r\n<p>We hope our Women In Supply Chain™ blog series motivates our readers to reimagine what’s possible and bring people from different backgrounds together for stronger and more meaningful collaboration.</p>\r\n<p>This month, we are proud to feature <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/beth-flippo-102b9822/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Beth Flippo</a>. Beth is the Chief Executive Officer and Founder of Dexa, an innovative aviation company dedicated to revolutionizing retail logistics with autonomous drone technology, aiming for a more connected and sustainable supply chain. She’s dedicated to developing and communicating a clear and inspiring vision for her company’s role in changing what’s possible for retail. Beth boasts a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the Thomas J. Watson College of Engineering and Applied Science at Binghamton University. She has a certification in entrepreneurship from Small Business Growth Services and is a licensed UAS pilot.</p>\r\n<h2>1. How did your supply chain journey start?</h2>\r\n<p>My journey began as an embedded software engineer working in robotics and unmanned systems. During the height of the pandemic, I moved my husband and four children from New Jersey to a small apartment in Ohio to be closer to Kroger’s headquarters, taking a leap of faith to launch our first drone delivery operation. With no furniture and little funding, we built our earliest prototypes on a kitchen table, turning that small space into the foundation of what would become Drone Express. Today, we are one of only four companies in the world with FAA Part 135 certification to operate drone delivery as a certified air carrier. We also design and manufacture our aircraft entirely in the U.S., serving national retailers like Kroger and Papa Johns. It’s been a path filled with uncertainty and grit, but also vision, resilience, and a belief that we could transform the future of logistics.</p>\r\n<h2>2. How have mentors played a role in your growth as a woman in supply chain?</h2>\r\n<p>I am an accidental engineer. In my senior year of high school, students had the option of taking Computer Science or Creative Writing. I chose creative writing. Apparently, no girls signed up for the computer science course. The computer science teacher, Mr. Jacobson, had four daughters and refused to teach the class without female representation. He asked the school for a list of female students who excelled in math.</p>\r\n<p>He then went to each of us, including me, and asked us to take the computer science course. I agreed. When I arrived on the first day, I quickly realized that I was the only girl who switched to computer science. I was very nervous, but Mr. Jacobson helped me through the entire course. I fell in love with programming in that class. I finally found something that I was passionate about. He encouraged me to go to Engineering School, even while my parents had their doubts. I graduated from the engineering school at The State University of New York at Binghamton in 1999. If it hadn&#8217;t been for Mr. Jacobson, I would never have become an engineer. The encouragement of one person changed everything for me.</p>\r\n<h2>3. What’s your experience working in a male-dominated industry?</h2>\r\n<p>Working in male-dominated industries like aviation and technology has been both challenging and isolating at times. Only 3% of CEOs in aviation are women, and when combined with the tech sector—another industry where women are underrepresented—the barriers can feel especially steep. There have been moments when I was overlooked or underestimated, but I’ve learned to let results speak louder than doubt. I’m incredibly proud to have earned an FAA Part 135 certification and built a nationally operating drone airline as a female founder. I’m committed to showing other women that not only do we belong in these spaces, we’re capable of leading them.</p>\r\n<h2>4. When did you find your voice in your career?</h2>\r\n<p>I found my voice the moment I realized no one was coming to permit me—I had to claim it for myself. That moment came when we launched our first drone delivery flights with Kroger. Standing there, watching something we built from scratch take off—literally—was when it all came together. I knew then that I belonged in this space and that my voice had power because it was backed by action, vision, and results.</p>\r\n<h2>5. What advice do you have for Women In Supply Chain™ and others looking to start a career in the industry?</h2>\r\n<p>Don’t wait until you feel 100% ready because the most meaningful growth comes from saying <em>yes</em> before you have it all figured out. Trust your instincts, advocate for yourself, and don’t be afraid to take up space. Surround yourself with people who challenge you and support you in equal measure. And remember: your voice and perspective matter, especially in the rooms where they’re not yet fully represented.</p>\r\n<h2>6. Who do you admire in and outside of the supply chain?</h2>\r\n<p>I deeply admire Sara Blakely, the founder of Spanx. She built a billion-dollar company from nothing, without outside investment by trusting her instincts in a space where she was constantly underestimated. Her resilience, creativity, and authenticity continue to inspire me as a founder navigating similarly uncharted territory. She reminds me that it&#8217;s possible to lead with both heart and hustle—and still win.</p>\r\n<h2>7. What have you learned on your supply chain journey so far and what’s next?</h2>\r\n<p>I’ve learned that I’m far more resilient than I ever imagined. Building something from nothing—especially in a heavily regulated, male-dominated industry—has taught me to trust my instincts, stay patient, and keep pushing even when the odds feel impossible. I’ve also learned that leadership isn’t about having all the answers; it’s about having the courage to move forward anyway.</p>\r\n<p>As for the future, I’m focused on scaling drone logistics globally and paving the way for more women to lead in aviation and technology. The mission is bigger than me now, and that’s exactly how it should be.</p>\r\n<h2>8. What does this Women In Supply Chain™ feature mean to you?</h2>\r\n<p>Being featured in the Women In Supply Chain™ series is both an honor and a deeply personal milestone. The recognition affirms that there is space—and a real need—for bold, diverse leadership in an industry that’s rapidly evolving. As a founder in drone logistics, it’s meaningful to be part of a movement that is reshaping how the world thinks about supply chains. It also gives me the chance to inspire other women to lead with vision, take risks, and build the future of logistics from the ground up. I&#8217;m proud to represent what’s possible when innovation and resilience come together.</p>\r\n<h4> </h4>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Women In Supply Chain™: Empowering Your Journey at Every Career Stage</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Whether you&#8217;re just starting or leading at the highest levels, our Women In Supply Chain™ membership programs are designed to support you in every career phase.

    "title": "Danielle Shuey Talks Advocacy, Meaningful Growth, and Falling into Supply Chain",
    "content": "<p>First, let’s talk about what’s happening in supply chain now and how women leaders can help. Right now, one of the biggest forces reshaping supply chains is the return of tariffs and shifting trade policies. With new tariffs rolling out—especially between the U.S. and China—companies are being pushed to rethink where and how they source materials and manufacture goods. It’s not just about finding cheaper labor anymore; it’s about avoiding unexpected cost spikes and political roadblocks. That’s why more businesses are looking to nearshore production in places like Mexico or Southeast Asia, where trade relationships are a bit more stable, and also investing in a greater manufacturing presence in the United States.</p>\r\n<p>Technology is also playing a huge role in this transformation. AI, automation, and digital tools are giving companies better visibility into their supply chains, enabling them to make faster and more informed decisions. Warehouses are becoming smarter, delivery routes are being optimized in real-time, and predictive tools are helping businesses to avoid delays before they occur.</p>\r\n<p>And then there’s the customer, who wants everything faster, cheaper, and more personalized. The rise of e-commerce changed the game, and now companies are under pressure to deliver quickly without blowing up their budgets. Tariffs and inflation make that a challenge. To stay competitive, businesses are moving away from traditional, centralized models and building more flexible, regional networks. It’s a big shift, but one that’s necessary to keep up in today’s unpredictable world.</p>\r\n<p>Fortunately, there are plenty of talented professionals who are up for the task of tackling an increasingly volatile logistics and retail environment, including <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/category/women-in-supply-chain/\">Women In Supply Chain™</a>. Because rising to meet the moment demands diversity in thought and representation, the logistics industry has a deep and vibrant talent pool. Our Let’s Talk Supply Chain <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/women-in-supply-chain/\">Women In Supply Chain™ program</a>, blog, and podcast series highlight the powerful impact of a more balanced gender representation. We hope our Women In Supply Chain™ blog series motivates our readers to rethink what’s possible and bring people from different backgrounds together for deeper and more meaningful collaboration.</p>\r\n<p>This month, we are honored to highlight <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielleshuey/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Danielle Shuey</a>, Vice President of Delivery at Loadsmart, a logistics solution provider. She’s a transformational operations, implementation, and account management leader. Danielle boasts a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology from the Wilbur O. and Ann Powers College of Business at Clemson University. She is certified in Change Management by Cornell University and was certified as a Certified Supply Chain Professional (CSCP) by APICS (now ACSM).</p>\r\n<h2>1. How did your supply chain journey start?</h2>\r\n<p>Like so many, I &#8220;fell&#8221; into logistics by accident, drawn to the pace, complexity, and opportunity to solve real-world problems. My career began with a one-day contract assignment involving entering NMFC codes into an Excel spreadsheet. It ultimately led to over a decade of experience across domestic and global operations, including an expatriate assignment in Asia.</p>\r\n<p>I spent nearly a decade at C.H. Robinson before taking on senior leadership roles at Flexport and now Loadsmart, where I serve as the VP of Service Delivery for our Managed Transportation business unit. I’ve led global teams, scaled new business units, and built scalable infrastructure to support our customers and teams along the way. I’m especially proud to mentor women and advocate for equity in this space whenever the opportunity arises.</p>\r\n<h2>2. How have mentors played a role in your growth as a woman in supply chain?</h2>\r\n<p>One of my first mentors was also one of the most important. He gave me my initial opportunity, bringing me on as a contractor, then hiring me full-time, and eventually promoting me multiple times.</p>\r\n<p>He believed in my potential, but more importantly, he helped me grow by delivering honest and often blunt feedback. He taught me to come prepared, to look deeper before saying something couldn’t be done, and to own my mistakes without excuses. These lessons have stayed with me and shaped how I lead today—balancing accountability with empathy and making room for others to grow.</p>\r\n<h2>3. What’s your experience working in a male-dominated industry?</h2>\r\n<p>Working in a male-dominated industry has challenged me to find my voice, trust my instincts, and advocate—not just for myself, but for others. There have been moments when I felt underestimated or overlooked, but these experiences ultimately strengthened my resolve and confidence. I’ve learned how critical representation is. Seeing women in leadership changes what others believe is possible. That’s why I’m committed to creating space for more women to thrive in this field and ensuring they feel seen, heard, and supported.</p>\r\n<h2>4. When did you find your voice in your career?</h2>\r\n<p>I discovered my voice over time through a series of experiences that challenged me to step in, speak up, and trust my instincts. Each new role, challenging conversation, or leadership opportunity helped me get a little clearer and more confident. I’ve learned that finding your voice is really about learning to trust it, even when it feels uncomfortable.</p>\r\n<h2>5. What advice do you have for Women In Supply Chain™ and others looking to start a career in the industry?</h2>\r\n<p>Don’t wait until you feel 100% ready because the most meaningful growth comes from saying <em>yes</em> before you have it all figured out. Trust your instincts, advocate for yourself, and don’t be afraid to take up space. Surround yourself with people who challenge you and support you in equal measure. And remember: your voice and perspective matter, especially in the rooms where they’re not yet fully represented.</p>\r\n<h2>6. Who do you admire in and outside of the supply chain?</h2>\r\n<p>I deeply admire the working moms I’ve had the privilege to work alongside throughout my career. Their ability to juggle demanding roles, lead with empathy, and still show up fully for their families has left a lasting impression. They manage complexity with strength and grace, often without the recognition they deserve. Their example continues inspiring me to lead with more intention and awareness of the many roles people carry, both inside and outside of work.</p>\r\n<h2>7. What have you learned on your supply chain journey so far and what’s next?</h2>\r\n<p>I’ve learned that I’m deeply resilient. No matter the setback—personal or professional—I’ve always found a way to regroup, adapt, and move forward. I’ve learned to trust that even the most difficult chapters often lead to the most meaningful growth. As I look to the future, I’m excited to keep stepping into roles that challenge me, allow me to lead with both strength and empathy, and to have a positive impact on the lives and careers of future generations.</p>\r\n<h2>8. What does this Women In Supply Chain™ feature mean to you?</h2>\r\n<p>Being featured in the Women In Supply Chain™ series is incredibly meaningful. It’s a moment to pause and reflect on how far I’ve come—and to honor the people who’ve helped me along the way. This industry is fast-paced and intense, but that’s part of what makes it so full of opportunity. I’m proud to be even a small part of shaping where it’s headed, and I hope that by sharing my story, others will feel more seen, understood, and confident in forging their own path.</p>\r\n<h4> </h4>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Women In Supply Chain™: Empowering Your Journey at Every Career Stage</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Whether you&#8217;re just starting or leading at the highest levels, our Women In Supply Chain™ membership programs are designed to support you in every career phase.

    "content": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, let’s talk about what’s happening in supply chain now and how women leaders can help. New tariffs are already driving ripples across global supply chains, overturning established sourcing strategies and disrupting production timelines. Targeted primarily at electronics, automotive parts, and semiconductors from Asia, these tariffs have many manufacturers halting or renegotiating contracts with long-standing suppliers. While businesses scramble to reroute sourcing to alternative regions like Southeast Asia or Latin America, they’re challenged with unfamiliar customs regulations, longer lead times, and limited capacity, factors collectively limiting inventory flow and increasing costs.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Retailers and manufacturers are wrestling with rising freight and storage expenses while goods pile up at ports pending new compliance documentation or re-exportation. The increasing complexity around import classifications and duties is forcing supply chain teams to invest in trade compliance and legal advisory services to keep shipments moving. In the United States, importers are reporting delivery delays of up to three weeks, especially for parts critical to automotive and consumer electronics production. Meanwhile, ports like Los Angeles, Long Beach, and Savannah are undergoing significant congestion as businesses attempt to front-load shipments ahead of escalating tariffs.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These disruptions are seeping into B2B relationships, with many suppliers renegotiating pricing to account for higher duties and raw material costs. Many companies are accelerating nearshoring efforts, but domestic suppliers aren&#8217;t yet scaled to meet new demands, leading to a temporary bottleneck in supply availability. Additionally, smaller companies, without multinationals&#8217; financial buffer or sourcing flexibility, are struggling to adapt, potentially triggering consolidation or market exits altogether. As geopolitical tensions persist, businesses are realizing that the new tariff landscape is a structural shift that demands long-term re-strategizing.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, there’s always a silver lining. Because rising to meet the moment demands diversity in thought and representation, and the logistics industry has a vibrant and expansive talent pool. O</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ur Let’s Talk Supply Chain </span><a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/women-in-supply-chain/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Women In Supply Chain™ program</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, blog, and podcast series feature the powerful impact of growing gender representation. We hope our Women In Supply Chain™ blog series inspires you to bring people from different backgrounds together for deeper and more meaningful collaboration.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There couldn’t be a better time to introduce supply chain powerhouse and thought leader, </span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifer-morris-iii/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jenn Morris</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Jenn creates supply chain content and is the founder of Ship Happens, an education company that provides supply chain mapping and services to inform people on the industry and its impact on our lives. She is passionate about helping companies optimize their logistics and operations.</span></p>\r\n<h2>1. How did your supply chain journey start?</h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like many people, I fell into logistics by accident. Because of a loved one&#8217;s illness, I was looking for a job closer to family, and I landed a role as an account manager at CH Robinson. Turns out, I’m pretty good at logistics and account management. Eventually, I outgrew CHR and moved around a bit before launching my boutique brokerage almost a decade ago. I founded Ship Happens at the end of 2023 after noticing an opportunity in logistics media, specifically for women and SMBs.</span></p>\r\n<h2>2. How have mentors played a role in your growth as a woman in supply chain?</h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Honestly, the only formal industry mentors I&#8217;ve had have been men, and they didn&#8217;t ‘get’ me. I was told many times to &#8220;dial back&#8221; my talkative nature and high energy. And I did, for a while, until I was a shell of myself. The only advice and guidance I take now is from other women who want me to succeed and shine just as bright as they do.</span></p>\r\n<h2>3. What’s your experience working in a male-dominated industry?</h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like many women in this industry, I’ve had my fair share of being talked over, underestimated, or mistaken for someone’s assistant. But honestly, it’s also been empowering. You learn to speak louder, stand your ground, and throw in a little sarcasm when needed. I’ve had to prove myself more times than I can count, but it’s made me sharper, more confident, and way better at calling out BS. Being a woman in this space means paving your own way and holding the door open for other women, too.</span></p>\r\n<h2>4. When did you find your voice in your career?</h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finding my voice was a slow build, part getting older and more grounded in who I am, and part watching a former employer systematically push out strong, intelligent women who challenged the status quo. It was disheartening, and I was angry. But over time, that anger turned into clarity. I realized I needed to channel that energy into something positive: a space where women in the industry feel seen, supported, and heard.</span></p>\r\n<h2>5. What advice do you have for Women In Supply Chain™ and others looking to start a career in the industry?</h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do your best to kick impostor syndrome to the curb. No matter what your brain tells you, you are intelligent, experienced, and skilled. Your opinions matter. So, speak up. Your ideas deserve to be heard.</span></p>\r\n<h2>6. Who do you admire in and outside of the supply chain?</h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, there are so many. In this industry, I find any woman who has carved out her own path and broken from the norm to be so inspiring. Sarah Barnes-Humphrey, Blythe Milligan, and so many others out there are forging paths for others to follow. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outside of the industry, my mom is the most inspiring person. She is currently battling an incurable cancer, she is living her life, and making the most of it, however she can. Her light shines so bright even in what some would describe as her darkest time.</span></p>\r\n<h2>7. What have you learned on your supply chain journey so far and what’s next?</h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve learned I’m scrappy as hell. Things go wrong constantly in this industry, and I’ve had my fair share of failures; some were my fault, some not, but I always bounce back stronger. I’ve also realized my humor and personality are superpowers. I’ve found that leading with humor and authenticity helps people let their guard down, and that’s been key to building strong relationships.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the future, I plan to grow my </span><a href=\"https://www.ship-happens.ca/blog\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ship Happens blog</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> readership, monetize it, help more SMBs through consulting, and even speak or moderate at an event or two.</span></p>\r\n<h2>8. What does this Women In Supply Chain™ feature mean to you?</h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being part of the Women In Supply Chain™ series honestly feels pretty validating. It’s nice to step back for a second and reflect on how far I’ve come and share that with others who can relate. This industry can be a grind, and it means a lot to be part of something that shines a light on the women out here making it happen.</span></p>\r\n<h4> </h4>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Women In Supply Chain™: Empowering Your Journey at Every Career Stage</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Whether you&#8217;re just starting or leading at the highest levels, our Women In Supply Chain™ membership programs are designed to support you in every career phase.

    "content": "<p>Supply chain resilience and innovation to quickly respond to market disruption are more critical than ever amidst ongoing regulatory changes and geopolitical tensions. Tariffs are nothing new. If you work in supply chain then you know that as long as they’ve been around, they’ve traditionally been used as a way to protect domestic industries.  So, what’s changed? Escalating tariffs in recent years are unprecedented, and they are sending major reverberations across supply chains.</p>\r\n<p>With various governments now imposing higher duties on both imports and exports, businesses are challenged with greater expense, uncertainty, and obstacles to remain resilient and competitive. The recent onslaught of tariff hikes is forcing business leaders to reevaluate sourcing strategies. That means abrupt shifts in supply chain that can disrupt expansive, established logistics networks. The quick jump in expenses may cause longer lead times and put companies in a compromising position—passing the cost onto consumers <em>or </em>absorbing painful financial losses. Either way, significant tariff increases severely strained profit margins—either by losing the bottom line or consumers who can’t afford the additional costs.</p>\r\n<p>Then geopolitical tensions add another layer of complexity to an already chaotic global trading system. So, it isn’t surprising that conflicts, trade wars, and sanctions fuel a disruptive market environment with businesses constantly navigating and pivoting to fast-changing regulations and political risks. This market instability hinders the movement of goods, long-term investments in new markets, and supply chain planning. That’s why supply chain and procurement leaders must rethink and diversify supply sources while rerouting shipments to mitigate unnecessary and dangerous risks. These moves often snowball into the perfect storm of delays and operational costs. The inability to plan amidst so many uncertainties is causing corporations to limit supply chain disruptions by holding more extensive inventories.</p>\r\n<p>The combined impact of tariffs and geopolitical tensions is reshaping the global trade landscape, pushing companies to rethink and restructure their supply chain strategies. While the industry is constantly ripe with fresh obstacles, these challenges present an opportunity to accelerate innovation and build more flexible supply chain networks.</p>\r\n<p>Adapting to these frequent and fast changes demands diversity in thought and representation. Our Let’s Talk Supply Chain <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/women-in-supply-chain/\">Women In Supply Chain™ program</a>, blog, and podcast series highlight the profound impact of growing gender representation. We hope our Women In Supply Chain™ blog series motivates you to break out of traditional gender roles in your personal and professional lives.</p>\r\n<p>With a volatile market ripe with changes and disruptions, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tracykosiarek\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Tracy Kosiarek</a> is the perfect woman in supply chain leadership to feature this month.

How did your supply chain journey start?</h2>\r\n<p>I started my career in the U.S. Navy and spent five years as a Supply Officer. This role allowed me to gain invaluable experience in logistics, procurement, and operational readiness in diverse and challenging environments. My tenure included managing supply operations aboard the USS Fulton in Groton, Connecticut. I oversaw procurement and supply chain strategy at the Trident Systems Command and Control Center in Newport, Rhode Island. One of my most formative experiences was leading remote supply operations at Diego Garcia, Indian Ocean, where I developed a critical spare parts program that ensured seamless communication continuity.</p>\r\n<p>Following my service in the Navy, I transitioned to a civilian career at Procter &amp; Gamble, where I spent twenty-two years driving large-scale supply chain and manufacturing initiatives. My roles spanned from crucial operations in the United States to Manufacturing Site Leadership in Saigon, Vietnam, and leading MRP-II and SAP implementations across China. These experiences deepened my expertise in global supply chain complexities and honed my cultural adaptability. Today, I stand as a leader in supply chain strategy and operations, focusing on digital transformation and empowering people to succeed.</p>\r\n<p>As a leader in supply chain strategy and operations at <a href=\"https://zinata.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Zinata</a>, I am committed to driving digital transformation while ensuring people remain at the center of change. The rise of agentic AI is set to revolutionize our industry, but one constant endures: the power of human collaboration. By bringing together the fresh perspectives of the next generation—including the growing number of young women entering the supply chain—with the deep expertise of industry veterans, we create people-centric solutions that redefine what’s possible. This is a pivotal moment for women and girls in the supply chain. Technology reshapes our industry and opens new doors for leadership, innovation, and impact. Together, we are not only embracing change—we are shaping it, ensuring that the future of the supply chain is more inclusive, dynamic, and driven by diverse voices.</p>\r\n<h2>2. How have mentors played a role in your growth as a woman in supply chain?</h2>\r\n<p>Procter and Gamble have always championed Women Supporting Women. Through this initiative, I met Jeanne Reisinger, who impressed me immediately with her ability to be present and care deeply for her team in Asia Logistics during the nineties. Despite the pressures of our rapidly growing business, Jeanne made everyone feel like her sole focus. She asked thoughtful questions, offered sage advice, and was dedicated to improving business performance. Jeanne taught me that supporting women enhances business results. We remain close friends thirty years later, and she continues to make me feel valued.</p>\r\n<h2>3. What’s your experience working in a male-dominated industry?</h2>\r\n<p>The funny thing about being in the Navy and proving to myself every day that I could do as much as my male peers is that when I got to the civilian world and in the Supply Chain, it seemed like ‘business as usual.’ I was used to working hard to make everything as perfect as possible, making my boss’s job easier, being creative about how to get everything done on time, and being able to go home to my family.</p>\r\n<p>I also started to understand the power of many versus the power of one. I had to work with my team members and all genders for the best result. Through strong leadership and respect for and belief in everyone’s capability, I was able to be more successful and to be provided with increasingly challenging assignments.</p>\r\n<h2>4. When did you find your voice in your career?</h2>\r\n<p>I had the perfect blend of parenting growing up. My mom instilled confidence in me at an early age. She always encouraged me to work harder, swim faster, practice more, and study intensely. While my mom was always stretching my boundaries, my dad ensured that we could smell the roses along the way—literally. He taught me that listening to other ideas and bringing a team together would accomplish much more than acting alone.</p>\r\n<p>I attended the United States Naval Academy in the early eighties when it was still new for women to attend service academies. Teamwork was a key to survival in those days, whether with your company mates or women in your sport. The concept of teamwork was reinforced daily.</p>\r\n<p>And when did everything come together for me? After a few years with P&amp;G, I left the US Navy and accepted an assignment in Guangzhou, China. The work was intense, the staff was young and eager to learn, and the expectations were extremely high. My assignment was to implement an MRP-II work process across nine manufacturing sites and three business units, starting with the General Managers and their leadership team and extending to all the Plant Sites. Concurrently, I was the SAP implementation leader for these nine sites. Eight of the nine sites used an abacus to do their daily work, and very few spoke English. When we started, they didn’t have computers and had no idea what Manufacturing Resource Planning was! After three years, our project was a complete success and was a direct result of the teamwork of our young team members working together for a common goal. To this day, I am still so proud of our team (many of whom are now industry leaders in China).</p>\r\n<h2>5. What advice do you have for Women In Supply Chain™ and others looking to start a career in the industry?</h2>\r\n<p>Don’t be afraid of hard work. Seek adventures across the world or multiple disciplines. Walk in someone else’s shoes to learn about working with others different from you. If you aren’t being heard, speak up for yourself. Support other women and speak out on their behalf when they are not in the room. Respect everyone, even when some are not the easiest to work with.</p>\r\n<h2>6. Who do you admire in and outside of the supply chain?</h2>\r\n<p>Early in my P&amp;G career, I was in awe of Mary Ann Gale, P&amp;G’s first woman Plant Manager. She is tremendously bright, effective at driving excellent business results, and always takes time to support other women. When promoted to VP of Manufacturing, she took time to meet with the women managers and technicians during each Plant tour. Mary deeply cared about how everyone was doing and asked penetrating questions about the health of the Site culture.</p>\r\n<p>She set the standard for supporting women in manufacturing, demonstrating that true leadership is not just about driving results but also about fostering an inclusive and supportive culture. I have always strived to follow her example, balancing professionalism, a results-driven mindset, and a genuine commitment to championing diversity in every space.</p>\r\n<h2>7. What have you learned on your supply chain journey so far and what’s next?</h2>\r\n<p>I’ve developed a stronger together–abundance mentality. Our consulting space is crowded with many firms vying for corporate, supply chain, or manufacturing business. There is room for those who can leverage their people’s skills. With so much AI and technology focus, we must guide leaders through all these changes, emphasizing the people side of change. How we treat each individual through the changes in our workplace determines our success. Respecting and understanding your people, recognizing that change is hard and each person’s voice matters, ensures that your people will adopt the latest and greatest technology and thrive through the change.</p>\r\n<p>My time in the Navy instilled in me the discipline, resilience, and leadership necessary to navigate complex challenges. My experience at P&amp;G broadened my understanding of operational excellence and large-scale supply chain dynamics. These experiences paved the way for me to craft my journey in consulting. They led me to my current work, helping organizations and leaders embrace transformation with a people-first mindset. In an industry that is increasingly opening doors to women, Zinata is a place that actively fosters this progress, valuing diverse perspectives and empowering individuals to drive meaningful change. As I look ahead, I see a future where more women step into leadership roles, technology and human insight work hand in hand, and the next generation of supply chain professionals—especially women—are empowered to shape the industry in unimaginable ways.</p>\r\n<p>In the future, I plan to continue:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Advocating for women in the supply chain and beyond. I have strongly advocated for women across the supply chain, manufacturing, and the U.S. Navy, championing opportunities for growth, leadership, and inclusion. Through mentorship, advocacy, and action, I have helped create spaces where women can thrive and lead.</li>\r\n<li>Inspiring the next generation by leading by example, I have continued to build a future where my two daughters—and young women everywhere—see that there is no limit to what they can achieve. Whether in business, leadership, or personal growth, I strive to be a role model who demonstrates the power of resilience, ambition, and integrity.</li>\r\n<li>Driving Meaningful Impact at Zinata, I have played a key role in shaping organizational influence, ensuring we continue to help our customers navigate complex change and win in the marketplace. By championing people-centric transformation, I have contributed to helping more companies, teams, and individuals succeed in an evolving industry.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>8. What does this Women In Supply Chain™ feature mean to you?</h2>\r\n<p>This <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/\">Women In Supply Chain™</a> feature is exciting, but not because it highlights me, per se. As a woman, the more that I can give voice to successful Women In Supply Chain™, the greater the possibility that other women will want to follow in our footsteps.

    "content": "<p>Sustainability is an escalating priority for consumers and organizations alike as carbon emissions continue contributing to extreme weather events and damage to our planet. The climate change debate is over—it’s real and it’s here—we need solutions in supply chain now. Business leaders understand recognizing and prioritizing sustainable supply chain solutions is a strategic move to fuel business resilience, profitability, and agility.</p>\r\n<p>The shift to circular supply chains is critical to generating new business opportunities while limiting the company’s carbon footprint and resulting environmental impact. Organizations like IKEA have already implemented sourcing materials from recycled or renewable sources and initiated product repairs to eliminate risk.</p>\r\n<p>There’s also a global move to goal setting for carbon neutrality. An evolving low-carbon economy is fast emerging as a business and government priority. And that’s where tech and innovation come into play. Adopting the right technologies will help organizations limit waste and streamline execution.</p>\r\n<p>But sustainable approaches can’t be cultivated in a silo. Partnerships will be key for collaboration across governments, suppliers, corporations, NGOs, and other stakeholders.</p>\r\n<p>Meeting the moment and the future demands of ongoing environmental impacts requires a powerful, diverse, and talented workforce. Our Let’s Talk Supply Chain <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/women-in-supply-chain/\">Women In Supply Chain™ program</a>, blog, and podcast series share the positive impact of growing gender representation with women and their nonbinary peers.

How did your supply chain journey start?</h2>\r\n<p>My journey to supply chain has been anything, but linear. It has been a winding path defined by a drive to learn, create, and make a difference— all the best pursuits are.</p>\r\n<p>In retrospect, I can see the through-lines of the last thirty years, including big visions, entrepreneurial spirit, collaborations, and mission-driven work. When I started my career at a management consulting firm in the early nineties, I was motivated by the firm’s vision to transform people’s work environments. With little experience or expertise in these matters, I found my way into client relations where I could share the firm’s vision while bringing others along. The firm grew quickly, and I was able to participate in developing new service offerings and a geographical expansion, feeding my entrepreneurial spirit.</p>\r\n<p>With tons of ideas and enthusiasm but little analytical or formal business training, it was time to get my MBA. I selected the Duke Global Executive MBA program, and it was the best investment I’ve ever made in myself. From there, I moved into supporting start-ups and was motivated by mission-driven work, whether public-private partnerships, social benefit organizations, or nonprofits. My focus on impact led me to the burgeoning field of sustainability where I saw the potential to reshape entire industries.</p>\r\n<p>There is a visionary design philosophy captured in the book, <u>Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things</u>, by William McDonough and Michael Braungart. That book imparted a new way to think about and ultimately solve seemingly insurmountable challenges for humans and the environment. It profoundly shifted my perspective, outlining a future where industry could be a force for good, not just the culprit and source of pollution.</p>\r\n<p>That’s the perspective I applied in dedicating years of my career to companies implementing this design philosophy. That brought me to supply chain work. Recognizing that my vision required a fundamental shift in how products are made and sourced, I immersed myself in the complexities of the supply chain.</p>\r\n<p>I&#8217;m now the Co-founder and Executive Director of ChemFORWARD, a science-based, nonprofit advancing safer chemistry in the supply chain through broader access to high-quality chemical hazard information. ChemFORWARD’s data-sharing model helps leaders make informed decisions at each node of their supply chains.</p>\r\n<h2>2. How have mentors played a role in your growth as a woman in supply chain?</h2>\r\n<p>While I&#8217;ve benefited from informal mentors who challenged me at critical times in my career with honest feedback and new ideas, the most profound influence on my career has undoubtedly been my mother. A career woman with three children in the seventies, she put on a suit every day, held management positions that women had never had before, and faced unguarded bias. Her ability to balance empathy with decisive action has been a constant source of inspiration. Despite her success, she bravely returned to school mid-career to earn her master’s degree. She has inspired me to try to lead with intellect, grace, and a continuous learning mindset. I strive to emulate her ability to navigate complex situations under pressure and inquire before making assumptions.</p>\r\n<h2>3. What’s your experience working in a male-dominated industry?</h2>\r\n<p>When I started, I was blissfully naive to gender bias in the workplace. I believed that if I worked hard, the results would be undeniable, and I could achieve anything. Thanks to the women who came before me, I could go far in my career before I experienced the reality: bias persists.</p>\r\n<p>Some of my experiences with bias were obvious, but most were more subtle. It’s important to acknowledge that subtle, unexamined, and sometimes unconscious biases are just as real in their consequences. I have moved on from some untenable situations, but it was with regret. I can only imagine what could have been accomplished if these biases were addressed and overcome. Everything suffers, from the work product to the business results and even the mission.</p>\r\n<p>Decades later, I am encouraged and inspired by a new generation of men and women alike who value collaboration in work, partnership in raising their families, and challenging traditional roles and responsibilities for both genders. I think there is more awareness of subtle bias now and a greater willingness to examine one’s own. At ChemFORWARD, we are striving to build a diverse team that values all voices.</p>\r\n<h2>4. When did you find your voice in your career?</h2>\r\n<p>While I&#8217;ve always been outspoken, honing my voice and directing it towards a clear purpose has been an evolving process. Fueled by what some might call &#8216;irrational confidence,&#8217; and encouraged by my mother&#8217;s example, I&#8217;ve never been afraid to share my opinions. My approach was to the amusement and occasional dismay of my bosses—especially in the early days. I think what has changed with experience, additional education, and maturity is that my aim is truer. With each experience and challenge, my communication became more focused and strategic, driven by a deeper understanding of the issues. Throughout my career, no matter the topic, clear and persuasive communication was required to achieve the goal.</p>\r\n<p>Today, I am absolutely certain in our vision to eliminate toxic chemical exposure in the supply chain. I am mostly sure about how we will get there and I am not afraid to be wrong and adjust course as needed. These elements, combined with a sense of urgency, embolden me to use my voice for good.</p>\r\n<h2>5. What advice do you have for Women In Supply Chain™ and others looking to start a career in the industry?</h2>\r\n<p>When you’re making a decision about which job to pursue or which direction to go, choose based on the people first. A supportive and respectful work environment is essential to your well-being and ability to thrive. Find a team where you feel valued, you can learn, and your voice is heard. It&#8217;s an investment in your long-term happiness and success.</p>\r\n<p>Don’t buy into the notion that there’s a correct path or a straight line in your career. Being nimble and resilient will ensure you end up right where you are supposed to be—fulfilled and happy with your work. Embrace the detours, learn from each experience, and never stop believing in your ability to make a difference. The supply chain community needs your talent, your passion, and your unique perspective.</p>\r\n<h2>6. Who do you admire in and outside of the supply chain?</h2>\r\n<p>That list would be way too long! I admire everyone working to make a positive impact on the world. I&#8217;m particularly inspired by people who put their egos aside—we all have them—to achieve a larger vision. One of my most admired female colleagues leads with the motto, “Better Together.” That means recognizing complex challenges require diverse perspectives and a willingness to share knowledge and resources. When that is your strategic framework, anything is possible.</p>\r\n<h2>7. What have you learned on your supply chain journey so far and what’s next?</h2>\r\n<p>My journey has been a process of self-discovery, revealing the core strengths that have always been there, just waiting for the right opportunities to flourish. This journey has been less about changing who I am and more about understanding my inherent strengths and how to best apply them. My natural curiosity, my drive to connect with people, and my ability to see the bigger picture—these have always been part of me. The opportunities I sought, while diverse, helped me hone those traits.</p>\r\n<p>The people I worked best with led by example and treated me with respect. When I had the opportunity to start ChemFORWARD, I was terrified and excited, but ready. Looking ahead, my focus is on ensuring a strong future for the movement I&#8217;m so passionate about. What’s next is ensuring the next generation of leadership in the sustainability and safer chemistry movement are ready. I am focused on identifying and empowering talent. From the talent and diversity I’ve seen as we have been growing ChemFORWARD over the last two years, I know we’re in good hands</p>\r\n<h2>8.

    "content": "<p>In the last Women In Supply Chain™ blog of the year, we want to take a look at what next year has to offer for industry trends and growth. There’s a lot. Technology, consumer sentiments, extreme weather, and geopolitical factors will all make an impact, forcing leaders to continue evolving. So, expect to see a serious evolution in sustainability and circular supply chains demanded by consumers and some governmental institutions alike. That means more organizations putting a focus on recycling, remanufacturing, and creating circular supply chains—all to reduce waste. Pack your annual business plans with sustainable sourcing and carbon-neutral brand commitments and logistics.</p>\n<p>Geopolitical tensions and battles along with anticipated tariffs will necessitate nearshoring production, supplier diversification, and proactive planning for contingencies. Your supply chains must be able to respond to disruptions and pivot swiftly to keep a competitive edge. That isn’t anything new, but it’s going to be more critical than ever.</p>\n<p>Automation via AI and end-to-end supply chain visibility will also play major roles in promoting more nimble, agile operations. Predictive analytics, the Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, digital twins, and demand forecasting will pinpoint needs at every node and step of your manufacturing and logistics journeys. Expect to hear the hype around autonomous vehicles pick up again, whether or not it comes to fruition.</p>\n<p>Whatever challenges come next; you’ll be more prepared to navigate them with a more diverse, resilient workforce. At Let’s Talk Supply Chain, our <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/old-backup/women-in-supply-chain/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Women In Supply Chain™ program</a>, blog, and podcast series continue highlighting the impact of that expansion in gender representation to empower the achievements of women leaders and our nonbinary peers. We want our Women In Supply Chain™ blog series to motivate you, so, you never let traditional gender roles get in the way of your goals or your ability to make a profound and deeply intentional impact.  </p>\n<p>It’s with great honor that we showcase <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mary-casillo-msa-6a550a12/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mary Casillo’s</a> supply chain journey, achievements, and powerful breakthroughs. Mary is the SVP of Business Development at Pallet Alliance, focused on sustainable supply chain orchestration. She fosters business cultures embracing innovation, the ability to make a broad impact, and inclusivity. Mary constantly leverages her abundant and growing social network to build meaningful partnerships and drive her commitment to excellence.</p>\n<p>Highly skilled in strategic communications, teamwork, emotional intelligence, public speaking, and sales and marketing, Mary is a powerhouse in the pallet sector who continues driving her career and her employers’ business goals forward. She boasts a master&#8217;s degree in sports administration and a bachelor’s in professional and technical communication. She’s dedicated two decades to building meaningful partnerships by showing up with empathy and solving problems.</p>\n<h2>1. Where did your supply chain journey start?</h2>\n<p>After earning my Master&#8217;s in Sports Administration, I began my career in the fitness industry, managing ten fitness facilities in upstate New York. My primary responsibility was to increase monthly memberships. At that time, I assumed I would remain in the athletic industry. However, I was unexpectedly, and quite literally, (fun story), tackled into the supply chain sector, specifically the pallet industry.</p>\n<p>Initially, I had no idea how crucial pallets were to the supply chain process, but I quickly learned and developed a passion for the industry. I wanted to learn everything I could, so I started with managing national pallet programs and made my way into business development. My passion to meet new people and assist their process and responsibilities has led me to where I am today.</p>\n<h2>2. Have mentors supported your professional growth in supply chain?</h2>\n<p>Throughout my career, I&#8217;ve had the privilege of learning from multiple mentors. There&#8217;s a mentor who fits every stage of your professional and personal growth. As we evolve, our mentors often do too. Either because they&#8217;ve fulfilled their role or because our journey calls for a different kind of guidance. Some mentors have equipped me with the knowledge to excel in my work, while others have offered the encouragement and advocacy I needed to stay resilient through tough times.</p>\n<h2>3. What’s your experience working in a male-dominated industry?</h2>\n<p>Working in a historically male-dominated industry has been challenging and rewarding. I&#8217;ve faced obstacles that have tested my resolve and determination but empowered me to make leaps and bounds. Overall, it&#8217;s been a journey of continuous learning and breaking barriers, and I&#8217;m proud of the progress that&#8217;s been made.</p>\n<h2>4. When did you find your voice in your supply chain career?</h2>\n<p>I found my voice the day I accepted who I truly am. As a masculine-presenting female and a member of the LGBTQ community in a predominantly male industry, I was once told that someone &#8220;like me&#8221; could never be the face of a company. That day my mindset shifted.</p>\n<p>Instead of working relentless hours, taking on more than anyone should, and letting ignorant comments make me feel I needed to work harder, I decided to focus on my strengths. I concentrated on learning what I needed to succeed. I started investing in myself. My confidence grew, and I trusted that I would find a place where I belonged with people who accepted me for who I am.</p>\n<h2>5. What advice do you have for Women In Supply Chain™ and others looking to start a career in the industry?</h2>\n<p>Don&#8217;t let other people have a say in who you are. Only you can harness that power. It takes time and a lot of work, but it&#8217;s worth it. Once you harness that power, you’ll become unstoppable.</p>\n<h2>6. Who do you admire in and outside of the supply chain?</h2>\n<p>I admire so many incredible women in the pallet industry. I&#8217;ve had the privilege of meeting and working with numerous smart, talented, and hardworking women who embody a no-nonsense, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to get this done&#8221; attitude. It seems that to be taken seriously as a woman in this industry, you need to possess all these qualities. Every woman at Pallet Alliance does, along with people I&#8217;ve worked with in the past, including Jodi Green, Mckenna Stewart, and Kim Travis. In the industry, I admire Kate Matz, Heather Willingham, Mimi Sullivan, and Hilary Carr. Leaders at women-owned pallet manufacturing companies whom I haven&#8217;t had the pleasure of meeting yet, already inspire me. I cheer them on in my head anytime I see women doing their thing in the industry.</p>\n<h2>7. What have you learned on your supply chain journey so far and what’s next?</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s challenging to discuss the future because I&#8217;m focused on living in the moment and taking things as they come. As long as I can maintain what&#8217;s important to me—family, friends, hard work, and humility—I feel my future is limitless. I&#8217;m fortunate to work for a great company and do what I truly enjoy professionally. I would love to speak to more people about my journey, sharing the tips and tricks I&#8217;ve learned to become more comfortable in my own skin and how that has positively impacted my career.</p>\n<p>I look forward to connecting with more Women In Supply Chain™ with inspiring stories of their own. I am ready to be a stronger advocate for the LGBTQ+ community. And, I want to continue making others’ jobs easier as a powerful force in the pallet industry—sharing solutions with the right capabilities. My hope is to make a positive impact overall within the supply chain community and on women in the pallet sector.</p>\n<h2>8. What does your Women In Supply Chain™ feature mean to you?</h2>\n<p>Being featured in the Women In Supply Chain™ series is an incredible honor that represents recognition of the hard work and dedication I&#8217;ve put into my journey as an LGBTQ+ woman. It&#8217;s also an opportunity to share my progress and inspire other women to pursue their passions in their careers. With this visibility, I can advocate for greater diversity and inclusion along with the importance of supporting and uplifting each other.</p>\n<h4> </h4>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Calling all Women In Supply Chain™!!

    "content": "<p>As we look back at supply chain management over the last year—whether you’re in logistics or manufacturing—there are signs of progress we can all be thankful for. The COVID-19 pandemic sent shockwaves across <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/old-backup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">supply chains</a>, highlighting regional dependencies and labor shortages. These disruptions continued through record climate events and global inflation. But, looking back we can see major improvements over the early 2020s, with supply chain organizations making major resiliency, agility, and sustainability gains through technology and new sourcing approaches. That’s because we’ve learned from recent years just how critical it is to minimize risk with the right systems and resources.</p>\n<p>So, when we reflect on gratitude for the progress we’ve made over the last year, we think about supplier diversification, nearshoring and regionalization, and increased flexibility and efficiency. These steps forward have built some extra protection to protect supply chains from fresh disruptions while maintaining momentum.</p>\n<p>Diversifying suppliers has been a major shift over the last few years with organizations moving away from reliance on centralized manufacturing and single-source suppliers. Instead, companies are building increasingly diversified strategies with multiple suppliers to limit their regional and partner dependencies. These moves away from relying on suppliers in specific regions can come in handy with ongoing geopolitical and climate shifts. <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-shoes-china-tariffs-steve-madden/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Brands like Steve Madden</a> are already pivoting production plans to prevent increasing costs in the new year.</p>\n<p>More organizations are still evaluating nearshoring and regionalization strategies. These supply chains benefit from moving production close to home—localizing manufacturing along with supply sources. This year, businesses limited major disruption risks by alleviating the clash of regional conflicts and global bottlenecks.</p>\n<p>We can be thankful for the major increase in adaptability and agility supply chains have seen across industries. Newer models enable organizations and their supply chains to shift seamlessly with economic, climate, and political disruptions.</p>\n<p>And perhaps most notably, we can be thankful for the number of women in the ranks increasing in supply chain. Gartner’s annual “Women In Supply Chain™” survey found that Women In Supply Chain™ now represent 41% along with a boost in C-suite roles topping 25%. These big jumps from recent years show the progress women are experiencing and creating across the chain.</p>\n<p>A Let’s Talk Supply Chain, we are thankful and proud of these leaps forward for women across the industry. Our <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/old-backup/women-in-supply-chain/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Women In Supply Chain™ program</a>, blog, and podcast series continue highlighting the impact of that expansion in gender representation to empower the achievements of women leaders and our nonbinary peers. We want our Women In Supply Chain™ blog series to inspire you, so, you never let traditional gender roles get in the way of your dreams or your ability to make a profound and deliberate impact.  </p>\n<p>It’s with deep gratitude that we showcase <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lina-castaneda/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Lina Castaneda’s</a> supply chain journey, insights, and achievements. Lina is the Chief Customer Officer at Tai Software, a SaaS company serving the freight industry. She boasts over a decade of customer experience and strategy, empowerment, service delivery, technical support, and quality assurance experience.</p>\n<p>Lina is a Certified ScrumMaster® (CSM®) and Certified Scrum Product Owner® (CSPO®). She consistently applies these agile methodologies and principles to optimize the performance and satisfaction across Tai Software’s customers and teams. She is committed to creating value and solving problems through innovation and collaboration.</p>\n<h2>1. Where did your supply chain journey start?</h2>\n<p>I am currently serving as the Chief Customer Officer (CCO) at Tai Software, a transportation management system for freight brokers supporting customers moving LTL and TL shipments. I bring a fresh perspective to the industry, having jumped into transportation four years ago with over 12 years of experience in Operations, Customer Service, and Customer Experience.</p>\n<p>Since then, I’ve served as a Client Success Manager, Director of Operations, VP of Operations, and now CCO. I’ve led diverse teams like Technical Support, Onboarding, and Learning &amp; Development. My focus is leading strategic planning efforts—ensuring that operational strategies align with our organizational goals.</p>\n<h2>2. Have mentors supported your professional growth in supply chain?</h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ve had many men and women mentors and both have played a vital role in my personal and professional growth. It&#8217;s important to relate to people&#8217;s stories to benefit from their experience. I&#8217;ve been fortunate to have mentors I look up to across different industries and roles.</p>\n<p>My mentors faced similar hurdles, and their guidance has reassured me that I’m not alone in those challenges. They provide the affirmation I need to trust my instincts and plans while helping me stay focused. These mentors help me find answers more quickly by emphasizing what&#8217;s truly important to help me navigate different situations on my own.</p>\n<h2>3. What’s your experience working in a male-dominated industry?</h2>\n<p>Working in a historically male-dominated industry has been challenging. It&#8217;s also one of my biggest motivations. Proving women can accomplish big things is crucial to encouraging more of them to take a leap and opportunities available to them.</p>\n<p>I’ve been fortunate to work with incredible men who have inspired and supported me from day one. They&#8217;ve empowered me—I’ve never felt different from them—we’ve always worked as a unified team. Their encouragement has been key to my success.</p>\n<h2>4. When did you find your voice in your supply chain career?</h2>\n<p>I found my voice in lifting up the voices of others. I discovered my voice the moment I found myself acting as an informal leader, and realizing people trusted me to act in their best interest—that gave my voice purpose. Empowering others, and helping them grow and develop through my guidance has been one of the most fulfilling and treasured parts of my career. It&#8217;s a privilege I cherish and will always carry with me.</p>\n<h2>5. What advice do you have for Women In Supply Chain™ and others looking to start a career in the industry?</h2>\n<p>Take every opportunity, no matter how challenging or intimidating. Put yourself out there, that’s how you learn and gain the exposure you need. Try not to doubt yourself. Know that you are enough. You’re receiving opportunities because you deserve them. Be kind, first to yourself, then to others.</p>\n<p>People will always remember how you made them feel and the genuine effort you put into helping them grow. Don’t take anything for granted or get too comfortable with any stage, title, or role. Things can change quickly. Focus on doing the right thing; hard work and integrity always pay off.</p>\n<p>And remember, our differences are our superpowers. Use them. Make a statement.</p>\n<h2>6. Who do you admire in and outside of the supply chain?</h2>\n<p>I am deeply inspired by women with relatable stories who have worked their way up against the odds in male-dominated fields like mine because I understand how challenging the journey is. I’ve been there too. I know how they felt in the early stages and the hard work it took to be noticed and trusted. I know all too well the internal struggles of knowing you&#8217;re capable even while doubting that <em>you</em> are enough.</p>\n<p>Overcoming imposter syndrome to achieve your goals takes incredible strength. I admire everyone who does.</p>\n<h2>7. What have you learned on your supply chain journey so far and what’s next?</h2>\n<p>Looking back, I&#8217;ve realized if things had been less challenging, I wouldn’t be where I am today. The roadblocks I faced didn’t just teach me about the world, they taught me a lot about myself. I’ve learned I’m stronger than I give myself credit for.</p>\n<p>When I am afraid, I push through it because there’s something greater on the other side of fear. My superpower is that I thrive under pressure in a fast-paced environment. I&#8217;ve discovered that I can inspire and motivate others without even realizing it. So, I’ve become more intentional in everything I do. I want to set a positive example and empower others to chase <em>their </em>dreams. No matter what they see as limitations—whether it&#8217;s age, gender, background, or language—I&#8217;ve learned differences make you gain exposure and stand out.</p>\n<h2>8.

    "content": "<p><a href=\"https://www.usa.gov/hurricane-milton\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Hurricane Milton</strong></a> has disrupted Florida’s logistics networks, impacting everything from <a href=\"https://www.logisticsbusiness.com/transport-distribution/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>road and rail transportation</strong></a> to portal operations. The storm has fueled effects that may disrupt industries for weeks or even months. Understanding how the industry can rebound means looking back at how logistics teams have tackled disruptions in the past and proven recovery plans.</p>\n<p>Florida’s ports can massively disrupt the entire global logistics network, especially for petroleum imports, construction materials, and consumer goods. Hurricane Milton closed key ports, including <a href=\"https://www.porttb.com/logistics\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Tampa Bay</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://www.jaxport.com/cargo/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Jacksonville</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.seaportmanatee.com/business/cargo/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Manatee</strong></a>. These closures paused the movement of essentials across the chain. Gaps have blocked the transfer of fuel, and construction delays for necessities like cement and steel. Milton is delaying shipments headed to the southeast and beyond. That means navigating obstacles and lagging lead times, redirecting the flow of goods to Georgia, South Carolina, and Alabama</p>\n<p>Tampa Bay and other major ports could be closed for over a month before receiving large cargo ships. However, there are some positives. Ports Everglades and Miami should be back to business as usual in the next two weeks.</p>\n<p>So, how can business leaders respond to unprecedented climate disruptions expected to only increase over time? <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/why-diversity-matters\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">According to McKinsey</a>, organizations with diversity of thought are 35% more likely to outpace their competitors which comes in handy in the most challenging situations.</p>\n<p>Let’s Talk Supply Chain’s <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/old-backup/women-in-supply-chain/\">Women In Supply Chain™ program</a>, blog, and podcast series showcase the impact of expanding gender representation and supporting the advancement of female leaders and our nonbinary peers. We hope our Women In Supply Chain™ blog series motivates you to let go of traditional gender roles so you can make profound, deliberate achievements that are uniquely <em>you.</em></p>\n<p>This October, we’re honored to highlight <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/karendbetancourt/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Karen Betancourt’s</a> experience, insights, and accomplishments. Karen is the Vanguard Medical Logistics CEO. She’s dedicated herself to logistics and supply chain management for over two decades, leading nuanced and complicated projects with multiple stakeholders. Karen has spearheaded major software advancements to redefine operations. She’s on a mission to fuel powerful outcomes without compromising quality. Karen boasts a bachelor’s degree in Management and Operations and an MBA in Business Administration Finance.</p>\n<h2>1. Where did your supply chain journey start?</h2>\n<p>My plan was to study chemical engineering at Georgia Tech. Plans change—this one due to my disdain for calculus. So, it’s safe to say that I spontaneously broke into Supply Chain during undergrad.</p>\n<p>I’ve led vast supply chains at Amazon in roles like Senior Manager of Strategic Programs and Technology, and at Walmart as the Director of Operations. More recently, I’ve focused on healthcare supply chains with Cardinal Health and Vanguard Medical Logistics, where I became CEO earlier this year.</p>\n<p>The transition to a medium-sized company from the likes of Amazon and Walmart is fantastic. I can leverage that big company experience while still being able to engage with people close to the operations daily. That’s the best of both worlds.</p>\n<h2>2. Have mentors supported your professional growth in supply chain?</h2>\n<p>Throughout my career, I’ve had informal mentorship experiences due to industry dynamics. Men I sought out as mentors were either hesitant or uncomfortable having 1:1s with me, or welcomed the opportunity in a way that wasn’t strictly professional.</p>\n<p>I learned how to make progress even if it meant only getting offered the breakfast time slot. Sometimes you have to be relentless and do whatever you can to get in the room with the people who can help you.</p>\n<p>Mentoring is what you make of the feedback and opportunities you have. It doesn’t always mean you have a formal mentor relationship—pick up those nuggets of wisdom and advice.</p>\n<p>As I’ve progressed over my career in the industry, I’ve mentored numerous women and men on a mission to ensure they have the experience I was never able to access.</p>\n<h2>3. What’s your experience working in a male-dominated industry?</h2>\n<p>When I entered the industry most women in logistics were generally clerks or a truck driver. You were either a secretary or could lift seventy-five-pound bags of dog food as well as anyone on your shift.</p>\n<p>To say I didn’t fit the mold of the people in the rooms I found myself in is underselling it. I’ve had all the negative interactions you can imagine. But it’s those experiences that prove how important it is to back yourself and other women.</p>\n<p>It’s been a joint, sustained effort with other women across the industry to redefine what success looks like in our field. Together we’ve demonstrated that it doesn’t have to be only rough-neck women who last. Women of all backgrounds and strengths can thrive.</p>\n<p>Believe it or not, it wasn’t just men who were blessed with analytical and strategic thinking even if that’s what we’ve historically been led to believe.</p>\n<h2>4. When did you find your voice in your supply chain career?</h2>\n<p>I feel most comfortable advocating for others rather than myself. But, one experience was the first time in a leadership role that I pushed back on a bad but popular policy. I made my case with hard facts and figures and managed to sway the other leadership teams—the policy was rolled back. I knew the risk was worth it and understanding that advocating for what’s right has been enormously helpful in my approach to communicate and speak out.</p>\n<p>I was kicked out of ballet at five years old for telling my teacher she needed to “shape up” so I may have had less to overcome than others to find my voice.</p>\n<h2>5. What advice do you have for Women In Supply Chain™ and others looking to start a career in the industry?</h2>\n<p>Progress is all about continuing momentum, not just a direction. Listen to your critics, they may be right, but you only get one shot at this life. Live it according to your goals and principles, not someone else’s.</p>\n<h2>6. Who do you admire in and outside of the supply chain?</h2>\n<p>If I could share them all, the list would be too long to relay, but I’d have to pick Christine Lagarde, the former Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>\n<p>Neither economics, monetary policy, nor global politics are simple nor straightforward, and she has always been committed (and engages) with her audience in a way that shows you can have personality, panache, and style, all while wiping the court with those who oppose you. Like all high-level roles, diplomacy and tact are critical, and she performed exceedingly well under the microscope of being the first woman in her role.</p>\n<h2>7. What have you learned on your supply chain journey so far and what’s next?</h2>\n<p>I’ve learned that I am more creative and unique than I thought. I am more resilient than I ever dreamed. Just because others can’t see me being successful doesn’t mean I can’t or won’t be. I hope that my future holds more in exceeding my own expectations and creating a more level playing field for everyone.</p>\n<h2>8. What does your Women In Supply Chain™ feature mean to you?</h2>\n<p>As a tenured member of Supply Chain, trailblazing is my main focus. That means advocating for and ensuring women are represented accurately across the supply chain and presented with equal opportunities.</p>\n<p>So, in that respect, I’m honored to be featured in the Women In Supply Chain™ series that recognizes the journey and efforts of so many women who have come before and those who are the future of the industry.</p>\n<h4> </h4>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Calling all Women In Supply Chain™!!

    "content": "<p>We talk a lot about the latest supply chain disruptions—they are constant—and how to combat them with diversity in thought and representation. Volatility and staying fast and flexible with changing market, geopolitical, and environmental conditions will always be a hallmark of manufacturing and logistics, but researchers are <a href=\"https://news.yale.edu/2024/06/14/yale-economists-take-aim-improving-supply-chains\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">examining how to tamp down industry chaos</a> in the future, and now is the perfect time. Why? Because consumers who drive demand and momentum are more aware of supply chains than ever.</p>\r\n<p>The COVID-19 pandemic era and resulting delays and shortages were the first time most people outside of supply chains had a view into them, or even grasped what the logistics industry was. Previously, driven by a fast-moving and growing online culture and a hard shift to overnight or same-day shipping and purchases on demand, most shoppers didn’t put much thought into where products and their materials come from; how they are assembled; or what the path is to their stores and doors.</p>\r\n<p>But, in the 2020’s consumers across the globe are dialed into supply chains, delays and shortages and how they impact their bank accounts, and the sustainability of it all. And according to Princeton economist, Ernest Liu, academics and experts of industry are combining efforts to better predict, avoid, and manage disruptions across the chain.</p>\r\n<p>And as technology and best practices continue evolving at a rapid speed, so are demographics in the workforce. That’s in large part because <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/effaa755-3379-42f5-8d54-91ca66c1a0a7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">organizations with more women</a> in leadership sail past competitors. Ending the gender gap isn’t just good for people, it’s great for business.</p>\r\n<p>Let’s Talk Supply Chain’s <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/women-in-supply-chain/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Women In Supply Chain™ program</a>, blog, and podcast series share the power of building gender diversity by investing in both female leaders and our nonbinary counterparts. We hope our Women In Supply Chain™ blog series inspires you to disregard traditional gender barriers and career roles for a profoundly personal and professional impact.</p>\r\n<p>We’re proud to highlight <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/clairemandell/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Claire Mandell</a> this month. Claire is the Administrative Director at Logisyn Advisors, a global M&amp;A advisory for the logistics industry. At Logisyn, she supports the backend of the business, overseeing financials, internal operations, and talent acquisition. Claire is known for her dexterity in balancing major initiatives while amassing a vibrant talent pipeline and streamlining systems and processes. Since 2018 she has built a career in different operations roles across the country, including positions in payroll and Human Resources. Claire sits on Let’s Talk Supply Chain’s <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/podcast/diversity-and-inclusion-blended/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Blended</a> Pledge board, working to elevate diverse industry voices around the globe. She achieved her bachelor&#8217;s in creative writing from the University of Arizona.</p>\r\n<h2>1. Where did your supply chain journey start?</h2>\r\n<p>My career journey took a winding road. I didn&#8217;t come out of the gates knowing what I wanted to do. I sought out and embraced opportunities to strengthen skills I wanted to improve on and gain experiences to bring me closer to something ultimately fulfilling. The end result has been exactly that, and I&#8217;d make the same recommendation to anyone, especially any woman, trying to find her place.</p>\r\n<h2>2. Have mentors supported your professional growth in supply chain?</h2>\r\n<p>My biggest career mentor is a male. Something he has done incredibly effectively is ensuring I know that my female voice matters and I shouldn&#8217;t shy away from it or compensate for it. It&#8217;s stuck with me and something I reflect on often, especially when I’m making decisions.</p>\r\n<h2>3. What’s your experience working in a male-dominated industry?</h2>\r\n<p>I have the privilege of working in two male-dominated industries: Transportation and Logistics/Supply Chain and Mergers and Acquisitions/Finance. The challenge suits me as I&#8217;m very much a &#8220;smash the glass ceiling&#8221; kind of girl. That doesn&#8217;t mean it is always smooth sailing. There are certain nuances and communication tools I&#8217;ve mastered and utilize regularly that give me better results and a better shot at success—mirroring, tone, confidence, timing, and picking your battles—just to name a few.</p>\r\n<p>One of the best things you can do for yourself as a woman living in a man&#8217;s world (really all women everywhere) is to become and stay deeply connected to yourself and your convictions. What do I mean by that? Ultimately, the confidence to be a strong decision-maker, to be persuasive, and to be effective comes from your sense of self. You have to cultivate and practice this, but if you do, it will soon become your default position.</p>\r\n<h2>4. When did you find your voice in your supply chain career?</h2>\r\n<p>Finding my voice has been a process and an intentional practice. Seeking out resources like Women In Supply Chain™ has been invaluable. After consistently reminding myself, I can do hard and uncomfortable things, it’s now an instinctual belief. Having candid conversations with other women about their experiences and journeys is always rewarding and educational. It&#8217;s been a proactive journey and one I am passionate about helping other women navigate.</p>\r\n<h2>5. What advice do you have for Women In Supply Chain™ and others looking to start a career in the industry?</h2>\r\n<p>My advice is to focus on the present moment. Don&#8217;t let the big possibilities and unknowns of the future overwhelm you. Small actions lead to big transformations, so take the steps you can today that feel right, and you&#8217;ll be on the right track.</p>\r\n<h2>6. Who do you admire in and outside of the supply chain?</h2>\r\n<p>I have the privilege of working with one of our clients, an incredible female CEO, who exudes everything that makes a woman successful She is compassionate; she is sharp as a tack; she makes sound decisions from a place of personal experience and weighted counsel, and she is incredibly witty and funny. Just a wonderful, humble, successful individual and an inspiration to see in action.</p>\r\n<h2>7. What have you learned on your supply chain journey so far and what’s next?</h2>\r\n<p>I have learned that I love building up new talent. I am passionate about taking things that look messy and organizing them into something that works well and makes sense. I love giving my teammates a safe space to be themselves. I&#8217;ve learned that all you can do is control yourself and your actions, and the reactions of others are a reflection of them and not you. I don&#8217;t know exactly what the future holds. I know that I love my company. It’s the first organization I&#8217;ve worked in where I can see myself building the entirety of my career (if I am so fortunate).</p>\r\n<p>A year from now, I hope I&#8217;ve helped more women find confidence and success. I hope I&#8217;ve given more of my time to a couple of organizations I&#8217;m passionate about through volunteer work.

Tensions have reached a boiling point in the regions in recent months. The war on Ukraine that started in 2014 and escalated with a Russian onslaught in 2022 has put severe limitations on one of the world’s major grain producers.</p>\r\n<p>The Russian war on Ukraine has been a devastating pressure cooker for global trade. Major global corporations like Boeing and Ford pulled operations out of Russia. Hundreds of ships stocked with corn and wheat have sat stranded in Ukrainian ports with war-imposed restrictions on shipping in the Black Sea. These restrictions have created food shortages and only added to global inflation rates. The price hikes directly impact raw material costs in specific markets and transportation spending across the board, creating fresh challenges across industries, not limited to technology, food and beverage, and manufacturing.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, ongoing conflict in the Middle East <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinessdevelopmentcouncil/2024/04/10/how-the-red-sea-dilemma-is-impacting-the-global-supply-chain/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">inciting disruptions in the Red Sea</a> is wreaking havoc on global maritime logistics. Shipping companies forced to reroute around the African continent are grappling with a profound and—let’s face it—expensive detour. They must bypass the Suez Canal for the longer Cape of Good Hope Route instead. The change in direction marks a powerful shift in international shipping dynamics, especially for Southern European nations. Experts are finding themselves grappling with questions about the positioning of Mediterranean ports and the future of global trade flows. These trends are causing a halting decline in traffic for the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Suez-Canal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Suez Canal</a>, a globally celebrated trade touchstone.</p>\r\n<p>And with elections underway across the globe, international dynamics still in flux, and wars raging on with little sign of stopping, geopolitical tensions promise to have a powerful impact on supply chains for the foreseeable future. These novel supply chain challenges require diversity in thought and in the workforce. We know that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/effaa755-3379-42f5-8d54-91ca66c1a0a7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">organizations employing more women</a> in leadership eclipse competitors.

We hope our Women In Supply Chain™ blog series motivates our readers to overcome traditional professional gender barriers for a profound impact and rethink what they can achieve.</p>\r\n<p>Let’s Talk Supply chain is honored to highlight <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/brenda-brajkovich-15612b63/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Brenda Brajkovich</a> this month. Brenda is the Marketing Director at Polaris Transport where she brought seven years of agency experience. Since 2019, she has been driving palpable outcomes at the company and has continued to help the organization combat hunger in and outside of local communities.</p>\r\n<h2>1. Where did your supply chain journey start?</h2>\r\n<p>My journey began unexpectedly when I joined a marketing agency specializing in transportation and logistics. Over seven years, I developed a deep understanding and passion for the supply chain industry and was fortunate to have a mentor from the agency who taught me so much about the industry. My passion led me to take on a new role in 2019 as the Director of Marketing for Polaris Transportation Group, where I continue to contribute to the industry I love.</p>\r\n<h2>2. Have mentors supported your professional growth in supply chain?</h2>\r\n<p>I&#8217;ve had a few mentors throughout my journey including professors, business owners and company presidents. Each has profoundly impacted my career by sharing their knowledge, experience and guidance—boosting my confidence and ability to advance in the process. Their respect, candid conversations and constructive feedback have been vital to helping me achieve my professional goals. I&#8217;m very grateful for all of them.</p>\r\n<h2>3. What’s your experience working in a male-dominated industry?</h2>\r\n<p>My experience has been overwhelmingly positive. I&#8217;ve had the privilege of working with respected male leaders who have supported my career growth. Their guidance, along with the recognition of my expertise, has been instrumental to my professional journey, fostering a culture of encouragement and respect. I’m also glad to see more women joining companies like ours where we uplift each other while working together to pave the future of the supply chain industry</p>\r\n<h2>4. When did you find your voice in your supply chain career?</h2>\r\n<p>Finding my voice was a gradual process, but one pivotal moment stands out. When I transitioned from working at the marketing agency to becoming the Director of Marketing for Polaris Transportation Group, everything came together. In this role, I could leverage my industry knowledge and I realized the value of my insights and contributions. It also helps that our CEO, Dave Cox encourages you to bring ideas to the table and will provide 100% support. This led to my greatest achievement with Polaris—creating the Polaris Community Care Unit program to help fight hunger in our community and beyond. So far, the program has made a huge impact across our community, company, team, customers, and partners. This marks when I truly found my voice and gained the respect of my peers and others.</p>\r\n<h2>5. What advice do you have for Women In Supply Chain™ and others looking to start a career in the industry?</h2>\r\n<p>I encourage women to join our industry where there are endless opportunities to strengthen their unique talents, grow, and advance on so many levels. Our essential and ever-evolving services will always be in demand since we’re at the center of managing trade across North America and the globe for a whole range of sectors. There are positions for all genders and skillsets—from IT to marketing, planning, operations, HR, sales, and much more. Today, more women are joining the supply chain industry, making an impact on how things are done and advocating for change. It’s a deeply rewarding career choice and I urge other women to explore supply chain.</p>\r\n<h2>6. Who do you admire in and outside of the supply chain?</h2>\r\n<p>I admire Lesley Veldstra Killingsworth, Polaris&#8217;s Vice President of Pricing and Market Strategy. She has made a significant impact on our company&#8217;s growth and has dedicated eighteen years to the trucking industry. In 2023, Lesley made history as the National Motor Freight Traffic Association’s (NMFTA) first chairwoman to join the Board of Directors. I appreciate her intelligence, confidence, empathy and integrity as she continues making strides in reshaping pricing structures for our industry. I’m so proud to work with such a strong, resilient leader and female influence. Oh, and not to mention she is a mom of two and never misses any of her kids’ activities!</p>\r\n<h2>7. What have you learned on your supply chain journey so far and what’s next?</h2>\r\n<p>I’ve learned that resilience and adaptability are essential to thriving in any industry. I’ve discovered a deep passion for transportation and logistics and have gained confidence in my ability to lead and innovate. Looking ahead, I aim to continue growing and learning within the industry, advocating for diversity, and contributing to the advancement of sustainable practices. The future holds endless possibilities, and I am excited to embrace new challenges and opportunities.</p>\r\n<h2>8. What does your Women In Supply Chain™ feature mean to you?</h2>\r\n<p>Being featured in the Women In Supply Chain™ series is a high honor. The series not only highlights the progress and contributions women are making in our traditionally male-dominated industry but also serves as an inspiration for future generations to join it. This recognition of Women In Supply Chain™ underscores the importance of providing gender-inclusive spaces where diverse voices can drive our industry’s growth. I&#8217;m deeply grateful for the opportunity to share my journey and I hope it encourages other women to pursue their passions and thrive in their supply chain careers.</p>\r\n<h4> </h4>\r\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Calling all Women In Supply Chain™!!

Recently, hurricane Beryl barreled through Texas leaving millions in the dark, shaking up lives, and driving <a href=\"https://www.accuweather.com/en/hurricane/beryls-fury-turns-deadly-leaves-millions-in-the-dark-across-texas/1667762\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$</a><a href=\"https://www.accuweather.com/en/hurricane/beryls-fury-turns-deadly-leaves-millions-in-the-dark-across-texas/1667762\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">32B in federal storm damage</a> expenses. The same storm left thousands of homes in Jamaica without electricity after the country was slammed by twelve hours of heavy rain. The category-four storm weakened to a category-two before pounding the Mexican coast with six inches of rain.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/us-news/climate-environment/noaa-predicts-the-most-hurricanes-that-it-has-ever-forecast-f566997c?mod=djemlogistics_h\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a> (NOAA), 2024 is set to be a record-breaking hurricane season for the Atlantic region. Hurricanes have already rocked communities and supply chains around the world, and we’re just getting started with the season typically running from June 1<sup>st</sup> to November 30<sup>th</sup>—peaking in late August and September. And we’re just getting started.</p>\r\n<p>A tumultuous hurricane season is hallmarked by supply chain disruptions. In 2021 Hurricane Ida crippled the world’s largest <a href=\"https://scm.ncsu.edu/scm-articles/article/the-increasing-role-of-climate-change-in-supply-chain-disruptions\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">petrochemical production plant</a> in Texas—halting it to a perpetual standstill. The outage led to resin and plastic shortages, including PVC, and impacted a wide range of products consumers use every day: plastic packaging, bottles, toys… the list is endless. And in 2017, Hurricane Harvey sparked a week-long closure of multiple Gulf Coast ports, including the Port of Houston.  Three of Houston’s major terminals were obstructed and freight carriers battled heavy congestion with flooded roadways and a driver shortage.</p>\r\n<p>According to scientists, while climate change isn’t fueling more hurricanes, it is making <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42251921\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">storms devastatingly more destructive</a>. According to the <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_Chapter11.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">IPCC</a>, a higher proportion of tropical cyclones globally are rising to category-three and above—topping average wind speeds. Meanwhile, global <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-07-09/supply-chain-latest-harsh-weather-and-shipping-disruptions\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ports are already congested</a> and the latest storms in the U.S. are disrupting a main gateway for energy commodities and their byproducts.</p>\r\n<p>These ongoing climate challenges require diversity in thought and in the workforce, specifically where it hits the hardest, in supply chain. We already know that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/effaa755-3379-42f5-8d54-91ca66c1a0a7\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">organizations employing more women</a> in leadership surpass competitors, so closing the gender gap isn’t just good for the world economy and planet, it’s great for business.</p>\r\n<p>Let’s Talk Supply Chain’s <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/women-in-supply-chain/\">Women In Supply Chain™ program</a>, and our blog and podcast series reinforce the importance of investing in gender diversity including female leaders and our nonbinary counterparts. We hope our Women In Supply Chain™ blog series motivates others to obliterate traditional gender barriers for a profound personal and professional impact.</p>\r\n<p>We’re proud to feature <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stacykirincic/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Stacy Kirincic</a> this month. Stacy is the Marketing AVP at Direct Chassis Link Inc. (DCLI) where she moved her career into supply chain almost eight years ago. She is a recognized marketing leader with nearly three decades of experience, largely in strategic, management roles. Stacy has a history of making a meaningful impact at her employers with a constant focus on KPIs and a deep knowledge of M&amp;A. Stacy boasts both a Marketing Strategy MBA and a Technology MBA from the Northwestern University Kellogg School of Management. She achieved her bachelor&#8217;s in marketing from Northern Illinois  University. Stacy is certified in Sustainable Marketing and Challenger Fundamentals – Core Sales Skills.</p>\r\n<h3>1. Where did your supply chain journey start?</h3>\r\n<p>I have spent my career in Marketing and the last seven marketing for a supply chain company. Before joining DCLI, I didn&#8217;t know what a chassis was, let alone all the other links in the supply chain. I was fortunate to attend several industry events, including RILA, TPM, and IANA EPXO, early in my role here, and that connected me with people and resources to help me learn.</p>\r\n<p>I had the opportunity to build DCLI&#8217;s marketing function from the ground up –taking what I knew well and applying it to a space that I was just learning. From brand architecture to content, from website development to marketing automation, I&#8217;ve been able to craft a customer experience that helps the market know who DCLI is and how we can deliver for our business as their chassis partner of choice. My small but stellar team (who are also Women In Supply Chain™) has accomplished amazing things for our company and I couldn&#8217;t be more proud of them.</p>\r\n<h3>2. Have mentors supported your professional growth in supply chain?</h3>\r\n<p>I had a wonderful mentor, Kathleen, in my late twenties. She’s still &#8220;who I want to be when I grow up&#8221;. Kathleen was the first woman manager I’d worked for and a force of nature: smart, independent, cultured, witty—a delight to work with and learn from. Everything I am as a manager, I learned from her. Personally, she taught me to stand up for my ideas, to overcome imposter syndrome, and not to say &#8220;sorry,&#8221; (unless I actually owed someone an apology). She’s still a mentor and a friend today.</p>\r\n<h3>3. What’s your experience working in a male-dominated industry?</h3>\r\n<p>I&#8217;ve spent almost my entire career in male-dominated industries so I learned early on how to navigate them. And that’s by never attempting to be part of &#8220;the boys club,&#8221; but instead carving out my own seat at the table and showing my colleagues why I have a right to it. There have been instances when I&#8217;ve been overlooked and/or singled out—sometimes intentionally and sometimes not. I always try to not sweep these instances under the rug but address them and then move on instead. Humor helps; I keep a quote from Charlotte Whitton, the first woman mayor of a major city in Canada, on the wall in my office: &#8220;Whatever women do, they must do twice as well as men to be thought half as good. Luckily, this is not difficult.&#8221;</p>\r\n<h3>4. When did you find your voice in your career?</h3>\r\n<p>I was around twenty-eight when I worked as head of operations. He was 5&#8217;5&#8243; (I&#8217;m 5&#8217;8&#8243; and used to wear heels). Even though I managed the firm’s marketing department, he had a go-get-me-a-cup-of-coffee attitude towards me. We were standing outside his office and I was speaking with him about an upcoming product launch and the production schedule related to it. Instead of looking at me, he was looking at what was about eye level with him—my chest. After a couple of minutes, I bent down, looked him in the face, and said &#8220;I know it&#8217;s a little high for you but my eyes are up here.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>He became flustered and ended the conversation quickly. I honestly thought I would be fired so I went and told our HR manager about what had happened. She laughed (she probably wasn’t supposed to) and said I&#8217;d done nothing wrong. Then she asked me if I felt threatened or wanted her to put the incident on his record. I felt so empowered and supported; I started being comfortable to speak my mind in any situation.</p>\r\n<h3>5. What advice do you have for Women In Supply Chain™ and others looking to start a career in the industry?</h3>\r\n<p>Women belong everywhere. Don&#8217;t ever let anyone tell you otherwise. Stand up, speak out, and, in the words of Margaret Atwood, &#8220;nolite te bastardes carborundorum&#8221;.</p>\r\n<h3>6. Who do you admire in and outside of the supply chain?</h3>\r\n<p>Maybe it’s cliché, but it&#8217;s The Notorious RBG. Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a pioneer and <em>the</em> icon for women succeeding in a male-dominated industry.</p>\r\n<h3>7. What have you learned on your supply chain journey so far and what’s next?</h3>\r\n<p>I’ve learned that I <em>do</em> deserve to be where I am. I struggled horribly with imposter syndrome early in my career. I’ve finally realized I earned every step that I&#8217;ve taken in my career. It isn’t a mistake that I&#8217;ve come this far, and it&#8217;s up to me and no one else where I decide to go next. It’s something I learned before DCLI and something that my achievements continue to reinforce, especially after starting from scratch in supply chain.</p>\r\n<h3>8. What does your Women In Supply Chain™ feature mean to you?</h3>\r\n<p>I&#8217;m very proud to be part of this series. I’ve spent most of my career in male-dominated industries, (and my life as an outspoken feminist). I believe it&#8217;s important to shine a light on how women contribute to the supply chain industry, and in turn, literally keep the world moving.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4> </h4>\r\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Calling all Women In Supply Chain™!!

    "content": "<p>Summer is here and we’re already cooking with fresh global supply chain disruptions. While wars and escalating political tensions are shaking up alliances and logistics, organizations are struggling to keep up with new sustainability requirements.</p>\r\n<p>The Supply Chain Act driving sustainability and putting environmental conservation first for European businesses is presenting new challenges for businesses looking to find compatible logistics and sourcing partners. In meeting stringent guidelines for new ESG and workers’ rights requirements, companies are finding themselves very limited when it comes to identifying the right vendors, agencies, and mines. <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germanys-struggle-clean-up-its-supply-chains-has-lessons-europe-2024-04-30/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Business leaders in Germany</a> in particular—where politicians voted against the Supply Chain Act—have been vocal about the challenges they are facing with the shift in regulations.</p>\r\n<p>However, The Supply Chain Act supporters say that acclimating to new ESG standards will pave the way for global supply chains to combat global warming and support better quality of work and life around the world. The legislation has the potential to foster responsible corporate behavior, anchoring both human rights and environmental operations considerations. Proponents of the act see it as a way to challenge harmful and outdated behaviors forcing global businesses across industries to raise standards. In addition, others have suggested that the law supports business growth since investors, boards, and consumers are demanding greater sustainability.</p>\r\n<p>Amnesty International has coined the EU initiative as an opportunity to close a gap that has allowed organizations to “escape accountability for widespread rights abuses around the world.” Major brands including Apple, Tesla, and other tech companies have come under fire in recent years for their use of <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-appeals-court-dismisses-child-labor-case-against-tech-companies-2024-03-05/#:~:text=EV%20Supply%20Chain-,US%20court%20sides%20with%20Apple%2C%20Tesla%2C%20other%20tech%20companies,over%20child%20labor%20in%20Africa&amp;text=March%205%20(Reuters)%20%2D%20A,Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">African child labor</a>. While American legislators sided with these organizations, there’s growing discontent among the growing majority of zenial and millennial consumer groups. Human rights advocates see the EU’s new labor laws as a win for human rights everywhere, especially when it comes to children.</p>\r\n<p>New business challenges require diversity in thought and the workforce. It’s not a shocker that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/effaa755-3379-42f5-8d54-91ca66c1a0a7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">organizations employing more women</a> in leadership surpass competitors in innovation and new approaches. Closing the gender gap isn’t just good for business, it can help the world economy and, in these cases, the planet.</p>\r\n<p>At Let’s Talk Supply Chain we’re honored to feature Women In Supply Chain™ who are reshaping best practices and business landscapes in logistics and manufacturing. The numbers show<a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/category/women-in-supply-chain/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Women In Supply Chain™</a> accelerate business growth and transformation.

We hope our Women In Supply Chain™ blog series inspires others to break traditional gender barriers for a profound personal and professional impact.</p>\r\n<p>This month, we’re honored to feature <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/caseyhyde/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Casey Hyde</a>, Reveel Director of Marketing Programs. Casey is a results-driven marketing and business development professional with over 15 years of experience spanning high-performance teams and program development. She’s dedicated to driving greater revenue and business outcomes through team and program development with a special focus on sales programs, campaign development, lead generation, and people management. Casey boasts a bachelor’s in science from the University of Michigan and has a track record of giving back through organizations like Girls on the Run International and the Center for Independent Living.</p>\r\n<h2>1. Where did your supply chain journey start?</h2>\r\n<p>My career journey in supply chain started in an unexpected place—graduating from the University of Michigan with a degree in Kinesiology and Nutrition, right smack dab in the middle of the recession. Jobs in my field were about as elusive as a unicorn, so I had to get creative. I found myself diving headfirst into the service industry, working my way up from hostess to General Manager at a local renowned brewery and event venue— the start of a path into tech marketing and people management.</p>\r\n<p>Eager for a new challenge and craving the fast-paced world of marketing, I made the leap into the tech industry as a startup business consultant. This role opened my eyes to the power of innovation and the thrill of building something from the ground up. I found fulfillment in helping clients set up new businesses for success before diving into sales where I discovered a passion for client relations and empowering business growth. I found myself at LLamasoft, taking on the role of building, managing, and expanding a global business development team and learning the ins and outs of strategic planning, team leadership, and market expansion.</p>\r\n<p>I really found my stride at Reveel with my employer’s unique blend of technology and finance. Now, as the Director of Marketing Programs there, I oversee the marketing programs and manage lead generation and business development teams. It&#8217;s an exciting role where I combine my creativity with my commitment to data-driven strategies, spearheading brand-awareness initiatives to optimize customer engagement and boost revenue. So far, my journey has been exhilarating. I&#8217;m thrilled to continue making waves in supply chain and marketing, all while living my personal and family life to its fullest.</p>\r\n<h2>2. Have mentors supported your professional growth in supply chain?</h2>\r\n<p>I am immensely grateful for the few solid mentors who have been pillars of support throughout my career journey. They’ve provided invaluable guidance and wisdom and been instrumental in bolstering my confidence and self-belief. Their unwavering belief in my abilities, coupled with their encouragement to give myself more credit, has been a constant source of reassurance. Their mentorship has been transformative, shaping me into the professional I am today.</p>\r\n<h2>3. What’s your experience working in a male-dominated industry?</h2>\r\n<p>Navigating a male-dominated industry is filled with challenges and moments of deep fulfillment. When I first stepped into this realm, I was met with a landscape dominated by men, their confidence seemingly unshakable, their voices ringing loud in boardrooms and meetings. Imposter syndrome and doubt crept in—<em>did I belong </em>or<em> have what it took to make my mark?</em>  It felt like fighting an uphill battle to prove my worth and expertise. I was even told by a former boss that I needed a personality change &#8220;if I wanted to have a seat at the table.” That’s when I realized I needed to select a different table or work to reshape the table entirely.</p>\r\n<p>But I’ve come to realize that our male colleagues have imposter syndrome too. They just don&#8217;t always talk about it. The pressure to always seem competent, knowledgeable, and unshakable is one we all carry, regardless of gender. Over time, I learned to embrace the challenges as opportunities for growth. I found my voice, standing firm in my expertise and contributions. I discovered that no one, regardless of their position or gender, knows everything. We&#8217;re all constantly learning, adapting, and growing in our roles.</p>\r\n<p>These moments of fulfillment in this industry have been deeply rewarding. Whether it&#8217;s leading successful campaigns, forging strong partnerships, or seeing the impact of our work on the bottom line, they remind me of why I love what I do.</p>\r\n<p>I&#8217;ve realized the power of resilience, determination, and a supportive network. Surrounding myself with allies who champion my ideas, challenge me to keep striving for progress, and celebrate my successes has been invaluable. So, to all the women navigating male-dominated industries, know that you&#8217;re not alone. We all face challenges, doubts, and moments of uncertainty. But remember your voice matters, your expertise is valuable, and your contributions make a difference.</p>\r\n<p>And to my male colleagues, let&#8217;s continue to break down barriers, challenge stereotypes, and create inclusive spaces where everyone can thrive. We’re all on this journey of growth and learning together and each of us can contribute to shaping a more diverse and inclusive industry.</p>\r\n<h2>4. When did you find your voice in your supply chain career?</h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Becoming a mother ignited a fire within me to make my voice heard, stop settling, and be selective in where and how I contribute my energy and passion. As I embraced the joys and challenges of motherhood, I also found strength and clarity of purpose. I became acutely aware of the importance of aligning my values with the organizations I committed to professionally. It was a time of reflection, growth, and learning to prioritize what truly mattered to me.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Above all, I wanted to find a place where I could be my best, and where the organization also gave its best to its people. It was important for me to feel valued and appreciated, to help model a healthy work environment so my children—especially my daughters—learn we are all worthy and deserving of spaces and people that uplift and empower us.</span></p>\r\n<p>This journey of self-discovery led me to Reveel where I&#8217;ve found a supportive environment that encourages me to speak up, share my ideas, and be an active participant in driving positive change. It’s more than a workplace—it quickly became a safe space for my authentic self, balancing the demands of motherhood with a fulfilling career. It&#8217;s where I found my voice amplified, my contributions valued, and my aspirations nurtured.</p>\r\n<h2>5. What advice do you have for Women In Supply Chain™ and others looking to start a career in the industry?</h2>\r\n<p>1) Trust your gut. Seriously, you&#8217;ve got this amazing intuition—listen to it! Take risks, step out of your comfort zone, and watch the magic unfold.</p>\r\n<p>2) Your voice is your power. Don&#8217;t hold back. Speak up, share your ideas, and don&#8217;t be afraid to shake things up. You&#8217;ve got the ability to make waves.</p>\r\n<p>3) Embrace the oops moments. We all stumble, fall, and learn. It&#8217;s not about the fall—it&#8217;s about how you bounce back stronger. Every setback is just a lesson in disguise.</p>\r\n<p>4) You are absolutely worthy of all the awesome things in life. Don&#8217;t let anyone tell you otherwise. Surround yourself with folks who lift you up, cheer you on, and believe in your dreams.</p>\r\n<p>5) Be unapologetically YOU. Seriously, your quirks, your style, your everything—it&#8217;s what makes you awesome. Don&#8217;t try to conform to anyone&#8217;s idea of who you are or should be.</p>\r\n<h2>6. Who do you admire in and outside of the supply chain?</h2>\r\n<p>My mentors happen to also be those I admire the most and span across the supply chain space, marketing expertise, EdTech, and other industries.</p>\r\n<h2>7. What have you learned on your supply chain journey so far and what’s next?</h2>\r\n<p>Throughout this incredible journey of self-discovery, motherhood, and professional growth, I&#8217;ve learned invaluable lessons about myself. I&#8217;ve discovered a resilience I never knew I had, a voice I&#8217;m proud to share, and a deep-seated belief in the power of aligning passion with purpose. Professionally, I&#8217;ve learned that my worth is not measured by the titles I hold or the accolades I receive, but by the impact I make and the values I uphold. I&#8217;ve grown to appreciate the journey of continuous learning, the thrill of taking on new challenges, and the satisfaction of seeing my ideas come to life.</p>\r\n<p>I am filled with excitement for the future and a path illuminated by possibilities to continue evolving, innovating, and making a positive impact. I am committed to nurturing my passions, honing my skills, and creating a world where my children—and future generations—can thrive. And as I navigate this journey with gratitude, I am reminded that the best is yet to come. I look forward to embracing new adventures, making lasting memories, and leaving a legacy of resilience, empowerment, and authenticity.</p>\r\n<h2>8.

    "content": "<p>The final days of spring are numbered as we continue hurtling to the halfway point of 2024. How did we get here already? Supply Chain is no stranger to change, challenges, and yes, general chaos, but this year has been its own kind of animal charged by a strained global economy, shifting tensions across continents, and a major presidential election that could have resounding impacts across business and commerce this coming fall. According to <a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/2024-presidential-election-may-have-big-impact-on-supply-chains\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Freight Waves</a>, the upcoming American presidential election can shake up global supply chains in a major way, with the potential for evolution in business and market policies.</p>\r\n<p>Anticipating the actual election-based outcomes on supply chains and across manufacturing and logistics arms is virtually impossible. What we do know is that presidential elections increase risk and disruptions across the chain. The actual effect of this year’s election hinges on factors like candidate and party policies, the economic climate, and the level of political polarization and resulting gridlock. Some analysts still attribute present disruptions being connected to the U.S. and China trade war. The impact of the approaching election and variables in the mix are made clear already by the striking differences across candidates and party platforms on trade agreements, tariffs, labor laws, and foreign relationships.</p>\r\n<p>Political shifts generally lead to variations in the cost and flow of goods. But at Let’s Talk Supply Chain we still think the best is yet to come. And while that tagline might sound cliché, we mean it because we continue to see the growth of women in executive roles across logistics and the supply chain. That’s important because <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/effaa755-3379-42f5-8d54-91ca66c1a0a7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">organizations employing more women</a> in leadership outrank competitors in profitability and customer satisfaction due to diversity in thought, new approaches, more effective communication, and higher resulting levels of collaboration. Closing the gender gap isn’t just good for business, it can help the world economy.</p>\r\n<p>At Let’s Talk Supply Chain we’re proud to feature Women In Supply Chain™ who are redefining their roles across logistics and manufacturing. The numbers show<a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/category/women-in-supply-chain/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Women In Supply Chain™</a> drive stronger moves forward—sooner.</p>\r\n<p>Women In Supply Chain™ change our way of thinking about limitations in the workplace. These new influencers and seasoned leaders continue finding novel approaches to respond effectively to the latest logistics and Ops challenges with greater performance outcomes.</p>\r\n<p>Let’s Talk Supply Chain’s <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/women-in-supply-chain/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Women In Supply Chain™ program</a>, and our blog and podcast series share the value in investing in gender diversity including women and our nonbinary counterparts. We hope our Women In Supply Chain™ blog series motivates you to look past traditional gender norms to the impact you envision making in the industry.</p>\r\n<p>We’re thrilled to feature <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariavillablanca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Maria Villablanca</a> this month, host of the Transform Talk podcast and Gartner Peer Community Ambassador officially ranked among the 100 Most Influential Women Supply Chain Leaders. Maria is the Co-Founder and CEO of Future Insights Network—an organization dedicated to connection, content, and collaboration among senior industry professionals in Supply Chain, Manufacturing, and Digital Transformation. She has nearly three decades of supply-chain-specific experience across manufacturing and logistics and a global business acumen fueled by her BA in Political Science and Government.</p>\r\n<h2>1. Where did your supply chain journey start?</h2>\r\n<p>In my first job after college, I worked in the food manufacturing space in Latin America. I was doing an entry-level job in operations that covered everything from sourcing, procurement, import, export, quality control, and manufacturing. I loved it because I knew nothing going in and learned so much along the way. After five years of working in this space, I moved to Europe to pursue a commercial career in publishing and media for the supply chain and manufacturing industries. I am now a content creator, mentor, advisor, and influencer for all things global supply chain transformation.</p>\r\n<h2>2. Have mentors supported your professional growth in supply chain?</h2>\r\n<p>I&#8217;ve had both male and female mentors who have helped me overcome obstacles to get to where I am today. Having an experienced person at my disposal makes decisions so much easier and helps to reinforce the things I already knew. Funnily enough, I&#8217;ve had tremendous support from male mentors who are strong advocates for women in the industry. These male allies have helped women like me become the examples we can set for the next generation.</p>\r\n<h2>3. What’s your experience working in a male-dominated industry?</h2>\r\n<p>In the almost three decades since I’ve started my career, I have seen a great deal of progress and positive change for women. There are many more mentors and senior women to inspire the next generation. Fortunately, these advancements mean that younger women won&#8217;t have to experience some of the negative aspects of being female in a male-dominated field. We still have a lot to achieve and overcome and I&#8217;m here to help make that happen.</p>\r\n<h2>4. When did you find your voice in your supply chain career?</h2>\r\n<p>The older and more experienced I became the more secure I felt in my own knowledge and abilities. I had to listen to my own voice and remind myself of my accomplishments. There was a moment when I was struggling as a young manager, and I had to dig deep to find my own confidence and inner voice to succeed. Having the support of mentors and people who I admire was pivotal.</p>\r\n<h2>5. What advice do you have for Women In Supply Chain™ and others looking to start a career in the industry?</h2>\r\n<p>Identify mentors, women, and men you admire and find inspiring. Remember to have confidence in yourself, and listen to your inner voice while you put in the hard work. One of the key factors that has helped me tremendously is finding and networking with like-minded people. Find your tribe and lift each other up.</p>\r\n<h2>6. Who do you admire in and outside of the supply chain?</h2>\r\n<p>There are so many it&#8217;s hard to name them all. I admire some of the biggest female CXOs in our industry for paving the way in a tough, male-dominated environment. Equally, I&#8217;m always in awe of women anywhere and no matter what age group, who stand tall and fight for their corners.</p>\r\n<h2>7. What have you learned on your supply chain journey so far and what’s next?</h2>\r\n<p>I&#8217;ve learned that I am agile and can learn new things. As people get older, more senior in their positions, and more experienced, they are more likely to stay within their comfort zones. I have found a love for putting myself into new situations and exploring non-traditional paths to build the kind of path forward I envision. As for what the future holds, I want to contribute to society and build a business I&#8217;m passionate about.</p>\r\n<p>I’m committed to continually creating more valuable content, collaborating with more leaders, and having fun in the process. Work is great, but when you’re building a future that makes you happy, the climb is easier and more rewarding.</p>\r\n<h2>8. What does your Women In Supply Chain™ feature mean to you?</h2>\r\n<p>The WISC series is a powerful way to highlight the amazing work by women in our industry. Being featured in this series is a true honor and something I take great pride in, as both recognition of my work and the experiences I&#8217;ve had in my almost 30-year career in the industry.</p>\r\n<h4> </h4>\r\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Calling all Women In Supply Chain™!!

    "content": "<p>2024 is flying—Q2 is here. It’s been a wild ride already, navigating continued inflation and escalating geopolitical tensions while keeping track of the latest global partnerships and mergers rocking market dynamics. Sound familiar? The global economy has been through a battery of shocks since we’ve made it to the other side of the Covid pandemic.</p>\r\n<p>The continuing conflict in Gaza with dire humanitarian implications is an ongoing supply chain disruptor and rising economic threat. Historically, wars around the globe have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/effaa755-3379-42f5-8d54-91ca66c1a0a7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">spiked oil prices</a>, accelerating costs and challenges across the chain. In fact, oil prices jumped 100% during the Kuwait invasion, 20% during the Iran-Iraq war, and 30% during the civil war in Libya. Oil prices have already reached a fever pitch, and the continuing death toll in Gaza could provoke another uprising by local citizens like the damaging oil embargo of 1973—an act of defiance by Arabs to the oil producers.</p>\r\n<p>With all this in mind, supply chain challenges aren’t going anywhere. On a positive note: the number of female logistics and operations professionals ready to solve challenges continues to grow. That’s important, because as we already know, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/effaa755-3379-42f5-8d54-91ca66c1a0a7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">organizations that employ more women</a> across leadership roles outrank competitors in profitability and customer satisfaction, in large part due to their ability to bring actionable insights and new approaches to respond to market dynamics.</p>\r\n<p>Diversity in thought is powerful. That’s one of the many reasons why at Let’s Talk Supply Chain we’re humbled to feature Women In Supply Chain™ who are redefining their roles across logistics and manufacturing. The numbers show<a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/category/women-in-supply-chain/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Women In Supply Chain™</a> drive stronger moves forward—sooner.</p>\r\n<p>Women In Supply Chain™ inspire all of us. These emerging influencers and tenured leaders unleash some much-needed optimism that we can continue finding innovative approaches to conquer the latest logistics and Ops challenges, or at the very least, roll with the punches. At Let’s Talk Supply Chain, we hope our Women In Supply Chain™ blog series motivates you to ascend beyond gender norms to make a meaningful impact.</p>\r\n<p>Let’s Talk Supply Chain’s <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/women-in-supply-chain/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Women In Supply Chain™ program</a>, and our blog and podcast series share the value of investing in your female workforce.</p>\r\n<p>This month, we’re excited to feature <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/abigailbaird\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Abbie Baird</a>, Production Planner at Ferrara, and our very own marketing consultant at LTSC. Abby boasts a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Arkansas and a business degree in Supply Chain Management, Business Administration and Management. She started her supply chain journey in 2019 and since then has been building her arsenal of experience across supply chain marketing, category management, supply, and production planning.</p>\r\n<h2>1. Where did your supply chain journey start?</h2>\r\n<p>I was a toddler who wanted to be responsible for making sure things were where they needed to be when they needed to be. I did not have the language, but I have always wanted to be in the Supply Chain Industry. I lost sight of that purpose, but in college I had a professor encourage me towards this path. I wanted a career where I did something different every day, not sitting at a desk doing mundane work. I wanted opportunities to contribute in a real way and connect with people.</p>\r\n<p>Since then, I have invested in the SCM community through a variety of organizations empowering Women In Supply Chain™. Through a variety of roles, I have found myself in the manufacturing space working with the people who make our products, the heart of our industry. It’s been a journey of building new relationships and professional alliances, learning the industry, and being open to new opportunities.</p>\r\n<h2>2. Have mentors supported your professional growth in supply chain?</h2>\r\n<p>Yes, and fortunately I have had many. My mentors helped and continue to support me in understanding new areas and concepts. They reassure me amidst uncertainty and empower me towards my goals. It is because of mentors I was able to step into my power and realize I have professional and personal value to offer.</p>\r\n<h2>3. What’s your experience working in a male-dominated industry?</h2>\r\n<p>Fortunately, overall positive but I’m cognizant of the continued gender gap. I work in a manufacturing space where each room I walk into is filled with men. I have seen and experienced men undermining my values and professional opinion; waiting until it comes from my male co-worker to believe, value, and process the information.</p>\r\n<p>These experiences have led me to be mindful of the demographic of each room and meeting, so I can be a champion of inclusion and diversity (not just for women) and represent myself with strength and bravery. I act authentically which for me is feminine, along with being outgoing and assertive.</p>\r\n<p>For a while, I was jaded about men in the industry, however; I have had healing experiences. Male colleagues and leaders have and encouraged and supported me in reaching my goals and finding my professional purpose. I am proud to be a woman in a male-dominated industry.</p>\r\n<h2>4. When did you find your voice in your supply chain career?</h2>\r\n<p>I have always been an outspoken gal. It was when I read <a href=\"https://www.momentoflift.com/the-moment-of-lift\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><u>Moment of Lift</u></a> by Melinda Gates that I fully understood the intersection of supply chain and mission. I always knew I wanted to tap into supply chain to make the world a better place, but reading this book connected my professional and personal experiences.</p>\r\n<h2>5. What advice do you have for Women In Supply Chain™ and others looking to start a career in the industry?</h2>\r\n<p>Stop telling yourself “no”. Release yourself from the fear of making mistakes or losing approval from others. Fear is very limiting and can control your professional life—don’t let it. Surround yourself with others you can learn from and be authentic and vulnerable professionally and personally. Give yourself permission to be vulnerable in professional settings. Supply chain, like most industries, is all about connection and that starts in your working relationships.</p>\r\n<h2>6. Who do you admire in and outside of the supply chain?</h2>\r\n<p>I have tremendous respect and admiration for Mariela Poveda. Not only is she the only female Operations Manager here at Ferrara. Ann Drake inspires me by boldly and unapologetically championing women and opening new doors for them. I also admire Stephanie Thomas and how she has driven momentum and allowed for evolution in her career through commitment and an ever-growing network.</p>\r\n<h2>7. What have you learned on your supply chain journey so far and what’s next?</h2>\r\n<p>I have learned that I need a vessel of creativity and connection. I love the strategic work I get to do, but dynamic work is important for my professional fulfillment. The future holds working towards mission-oriented work, using supply chain professionals, and empowering women through it all.</p>\r\n<p>As my journey continues, I hope to see more women break into manufacturing leadership roles. There are still too many excuses in the space limiting women and their ability to succeed. I want to build a career with a mission, finding purpose in my work and using it to positively impact the world.</p>\r\n<p>Most of all, I hope to work with others to harness supply chain to move the needle for women and their socioeconomic status. We in the chain can take real steps in combating poverty—I want to be part of that.</p>\r\n<h2>8.

    "content": "<p>Q2 is just around the corner. 2024 has brought a fresh sense of urgency to the global supply chain amidst growing regional wars and tensions, and calls from climate scientists have kept sustainability initiatives a top priority. Rising sea levels and major <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/02/13/climate/flooding-sea-levels-groundwater.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">American metropolitans slowly sinking</a> have climate scientists on high alert and raising the alarm for government and commercial organizations.</p>\r\n<p>The Russian war and attempted invasion of Ukraine and other global conflicts have made the safe passage of cargo across the Red and Black Seas more problematic than ever, while cutting off some major global suppliers.</p>\r\n<p>The supply chain isn’t getting any less complicated. But thankfully, now we have more women in logistics to help solve the latest issues. We saw meaningful <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/supply-chain-leader-becky-simon-on-having-a-heart-of-service/\">progress for Women In Supply Chain™ last year</a> with a powerful leap in executive representation and activity for women across the chain. Frontline representation remained steady at 31% and the overall number of women in the supply chain community made a 5% increase—a trend that continues.</p>\r\n<p>To face the latest wave of market challenges and logistics obstacles, more organizations are investing in diversifying their workforces and letting women take the lead. At Let’s Talk Supply Chain, we’re honored to feature Women In Supply Chain™ breaking out of traditional gender roles across global logistics, transportation, and manufacturing. These stats show that<a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/category/women-in-supply-chain/\"> Women In Supply Chain™</a> drive bigger, faster moves forward and greater profitability while igniting higher levels of global collaboration.</p>\r\n<p>Women In Supply Chain™ motivate us. They give us hope for finding novel approaches in our fast-evolving world. At Let’s Talk Supply Chain, we hope our Women In Supply Chain™ blog series inspires other female professionals looking to ascend far beyond glass ceilings to make a tangible impact.</p>\r\n<p>Let’s Talk Supply Chain’s <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/women-in-supply-chain/\">Women In Supply Chain™ program</a>, and these blog highlights show the undeniable competitive advantage in investing in your female workforce. Empowering women in your ranks is proven to spike higher revenue and ROI. More than half of businesses dedicated to gender equity and diversity have 50% higher profitability and 61% higher revenue growth than competitors. And over 70% rank highest in customer satisfaction.</p>\r\n<p>This month, we’re excited to feature <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/katie-date-89573215/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Katie Date</a>, SVP of Industry Relations &amp; Strategic Initiatives at Manifest: The Future of Logistics. Katie has two decades of experience connecting businesses, research, and education, working in different capacities across the supply chain. As the SVP of Industry Relations and Strategic Initiatives at Manifest, she spearheads organizational efforts to foster strategic partnerships, empower innovation, and advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEIB) in the industry. Katie previously founded and let the Women In Supply Chain™ Initiative at MIT, a groundbreaking project making greater knowledge and resources accessible for a more diverse and inclusive workplace.</p>\r\n<h2>1. Where did your supply chain journey start?</h2>\r\n<p>There have been a lot of twists and turns. When I first worked in a distribution center more than two decades ago I didn’t know the word <em>supply chain.</em> I look back at that experience often. I have largely worked in male-dominated industries and for the first decade of my career, I never really thought about that.</p>\r\n<p>I was good at being a part of the &#8221; boys club&#8221; and thrived in the environment. I learned a lot of lessons along the way and valued that experience. It wasn&#8217;t until about ten years ago that I started to question why I was still the only woman at the table and felt a responsibility to make sure it didn&#8217;t stay that way.</p>\r\n<p>That is why in 2017 I founded the Women In Supply Chain™ Initiative at the MIT Center for Transportation and Logistics. Now in 2024, just coming off a very successful Manifest Vegas and finally seeing women in top positions in the supply chain, I am encouraged about the momentum. I am excited about the emerging leaders. The women stepping into leadership for the first time are taking the supply chain in exciting new directions and I cannot wait to see where it goes.</p>\r\n<h2>2. Have mentors supported your professional growth in supply chain?</h2>\r\n<p>I have been fortunate to have many great mentors both formal and informal, men and women. Some of my best mentors have been those who have pushed me outside of my comfort zone—that’s where I have seen the most growth. My mentors have also encouraged me to think differently and exposed me to opportunities I wouldn&#8217;t have necessarily had access to otherwise so I could make a meaningful difference.</p>\r\n<h2>3. What’s your experience working in a male-dominated industry?</h2>\r\n<p>My experience in the industry has been positive overall. Most of my male colleagues have been very supportive of my career development and growth. Unfortunately, my biggest obstacles have been a small set of women who have stood in the way. That is one of the reasons I am so passionate about creating opportunities for women to grow. It is hard enough already and standing in the way of others is unacceptable. One of my favorite quotes is by Madeleine Albright. “There is a special place in hell for women who don&#8217;t help other women.&#8221;</p>\r\n<h2>4. When did you find your voice in your supply chain career?</h2>\r\n<p>I’ve never been shy about expressing my opinions. My parents often talk about the time when I was in the sixth grade, and I told the teacher I could teach the class better than she could, (I was probably right). What I struggled with was how to use that voice in an impactful way. Many years later it clicked and even then it took some refinements. In 2017 when I finally put my flag in the ground and created the Women In Supply Chain™ Initiative that was the first step.</p>\r\n<p>It was encouraging to see so many leaders in the Supply Chain come together around a common goal. If I had to draw on one moment where everything really came together it would be in October 2019 when I delivered the keynote address for the International Congress of Industrial Engineers in Bucaramanga Colombia. I gave the first part of the talk in Spanish (not my native language). This was so far outside my comfort zone, but the feedback I received after taught me that the most important thing I can do is connect with people. Since that moment it has been my intention in every talk I give to make that connection—even just one. That small shift has paid off in dividends. I feel like I am truly making a difference.</p>\r\n<h2>5. What advice do you have for Women In Supply Chain™ and others looking to start a career in the industry?</h2>\r\n<p>Say yes to opportunity. Trying to chart a path in the supply chain can be maddening, but by saying yes to stretch assignments or new opportunities we open ourselves to growth and new corners we never knew existed.</p>\r\n<p>Make sure to bring other women along as you grow. You may have had to fight for your place at the table but if you can make it easier for someone else along the way then you are doing your part.</p>\r\n<h2>6. Who do you admire in and outside of the supply chain?</h2>\r\n<p>I admire and respect so many professionals in and outside of supply chain. One of the people that has made the biggest impact on me is Kip Hollister. Kip is the founder of The Hollister Group. She is the first person who taught me the importance of bringing your whole self to work. Kip invests in her employees and really prioritizes the wellbeing of each person. Even though I haven&#8217;t worked for her in almost 15 years, I still draw on the things she taught me almost daily.</p>\r\n<p>I also really admire Courtney Muller, the President of Manifest. Not only did she see something special in me and give me the opportunity of a lifetime, but she has been identifying opportunity for other women throughout her career. Being a C-level executive in the male-dominated events industry isn’t easy. Courtney has never been afraid to chart a path forward and bring women together around the common goal of growth.</p>\r\n<h2>7. What have you learned on your supply chain journey so far and what’s next?</h2>\r\n<p>I have learned the importance of being deliberate both with my time and with others. It is very easy to say <em>yes</em> to everything. But the more I have become intentional with my time the more valuable my connections have become. The future is bright and full of energy.</p>\r\n<p>I love what I am doing with Manifest, I feel so lucky to be a part of such an important event for our industry. I am also excited about the work that I am doing with Women In Supply Chain™. Leading groups with other women has always been something I see value in so I can&#8217;t wait to see where it all goes.</p>\r\n<p>I’ll continue working towards driving more gender diversity in our industry. For me that means driving more diversity in all ranks of the supply chain, helping women know their worth and receive equal pay for what we do, and building a stronger community.</p>\r\n<p>We are better when we come together. I’d like to see women coming together in a common group instead of smaller, competing groups so we can achieve more for each other.</p>\r\n<h2>8. What does your Women In Supply Chain™ feature mean to you?</h2>\r\n<p>It is such an honor to be recognized by the Supply Chain community like this. To be in the company of such accomplished female leaders is such a pleasure. The more we can highlight the great things women in the supply chain are doing the more we can elevate the position of women.</p>\r\n<h4> </h4>\r\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Calling all Women In Supply Chain™!!

Where did your supply chain journey start?</h2>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">Like many others, my journey in the supply chain industry began quite unexpectedly. At the age of eighteen, I stumbled into logistics, recruited during one of my shifts at a local automotive store. Starting at a small transportation brokerage, I delved into the intricacies of managing a small business while attending courses at a community college in the Chicagoland area during the evenings. Initially, I never envisioned transportation becoming my lifelong career. I became immersed in the chaos of the industry and discovered a passion for contributing to the movement of goods and the intricate dance between manufacturers, carriers, and drivers.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">In those early days, mentioning that I worked in logistics often raised eyebrows, especially as a young woman. Despite the skepticism, I persevered, driven by my love for problem-solving and the satisfaction of making things happen for clients and partners. Over eight years, I honed my skills in operations, embracing the challenges that came with it. 2008, I transitioned to transportation sales, expecting it to be a seamless shift, given my experience and communication skills. Little did I know that this move would reshape my mindset, emphasizing individual growth and putting me in a leadership role for the first time.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">Over the next four years, I navigated the challenges of transportation sales and contributed to the company&#8217;s growth. In 2011, I took a significant step forward when I was appointed the company&#8217;s President, marking my entry into executive leadership. Despite initial discomfort and concerns about leading change, I embraced the role, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and personal development within the team. Witnessing the transformative impact on individuals and the company, I found a new passion for developing people and stayed committed to leadership roles.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">As my journey unfolded, so did the conception of Candor Expedite, which took root in my mind two years before its inception. Fueled by a desire to create a company with a distinct mission, I recognized that venturing out on my own was the only way to manifest that vision securely. The name Candor Expedite was a deliberate move to reflect my experiences of 18 years in logistics where I witnessed pervasive dishonesty causing disruptions in the supply chain. I envisioned a company that would cut through the confusion, providing clarity, honesty, transparency, and exceptional service to manufacturing clients.</p>\r\n<h2 class=\"p3\">2.  Have supply chain mentors helped your professional momentum?</h2>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">I&#8217;ve been fortunate to have multiple mentors who significantly altered my perspectives, providing a secure environment for personal growth, vulnerability, and incorporating their feedback to effect positive changes in my life. Embracing mentorship stands out as the most impactful leap I&#8217;ve ever taken.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">In 2020, amid the pandemic, I recognized my isolation while running a company based solely on business books and my own knowledge, realizing its limitations. Determined to broaden my network, I engaged with ten different individuals in a month, leading to transformative outcomes. Opening up to mentorship was crucial—I attended conferences, spoke with people in my community, and utilized LinkedIn to connect with professionals in my industry. Joining relevant LinkedIn groups proved invaluable.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">A key lesson learned was not being afraid to ask people for their time. I approached potential mentors with a well-thought-out agenda, sharing what I sought from the mentorship. Taking initiative with mentors is vital; they are busy individuals, and ongoing conversations require proactive engagement.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\">In 2021, I became a member of Vistage, a CEO group facilitating collaboration with fellow executives, exposure to insightful speakers, and leveraging my chair leader as a coach. Mentorship, in its diverse forms, has not only spurred fresh perspectives, illuminated blind spots, and enhanced my leadership skills with my team but has also played a pivotal role in decision-making and learning how to scale a business.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p7\">I must emphasize that I wouldn&#8217;t have been able to grow this far without my network and mentors. They mean the world to me, providing guidance, support, and invaluable insights that have shaped both my professional journey and the success of my business.</p>\r\n<h2 class=\"p3\">3.  What’s your experience working in a male-dominated industry?</h2>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">Having stepped into the male-dominated trucking world in 2000, my journey has been an odyssey of resilience and growth. I had and still have male mentors who generously took me under their wings, imparting wisdom beyond my wildest expectations. The scarcity of women in the industry was palpable, but I chose to view it as an advantage rather than a hindrance.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">My gender did not escape notice, and I encountered situations that irked me. However, I steadfastly refused to let these moments become obstacles. The organizations I aligned with were not just workplaces but reflections of my values. These companies stood for principles I believed in, providing a supportive backdrop for my aspirations.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">Reflecting on the 2023 Women in Trucking (WIT) Index report, I can&#8217;t help but marvel at the positive trajectory we&#8217;ve embarked upon. The statistics reveal a notable surge in the representation of women in the trucking industry, a stark departure from the historical norms of the past two decades. While the data shows a slight dip in the percentage of women in leadership roles from 39.6% in 2022 to 36.9% in 2023, the overarching trend still underscores a significant and sustained presence of women in leadership positions. This nuanced fluctuation is a natural part of the ongoing organizational evolution within the trucking industry, where the focus is increasingly on genuine equality and meritocracy.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p8\">The Women in Trucking Association, where I&#8217;m proud to be a member, has played a pivotal role in advocating gender diversity and inclusion. With around 8,000 members across over ten countries, the association aligns with the positive trends identified in the report, working tirelessly to encourage women&#8217;s employment in the trucking industry and minimize the obstacles we face. As the trucking sector continues its evolution, these trends promise not just progress but a future where opportunities for women abound, creating a workplace that mirrors the diversity of the broader community. My personal experience in this journey only reinforce my belief that we are steering towards a more inclusive horizon.</p>\r\n<h2 class=\"p9\">4. When did you find your voice in your supply chain career?</h2>\r\n<p class=\"p7\">I&#8217;m on a continuous journey of finding my voice, touching on it through podcasts, conversations with mentors, and advice sessions for others. Each moment I feel everything has come together is followed by the realization that there&#8217;s more work ahead. It&#8217;s an ongoing process, and while I&#8217;ve had about ten of those defining moments, I eagerly anticipate the next one hundred that will shape my evolving self.</p>\r\n<h2 class=\"p10\">5.  What advice do you have for Women In Supply Chain™ and others looking to start a career in the industry?</h2>\r\n<p class=\"p6\">If I could turn back time, I&#8217;d share a piece of advice with my past self: things will fall into place, and some things are beyond your control—learn to let go. Focus on continuous personal growth, professional development, and expanding your network. Don&#8217;t hesitate to ask boldly for what you want, whether it&#8217;s a new position, the ability to tackle a project, or finding a mentor. Don&#8217;t worry about what others might think; what you perceive as a potential negative is often not even on their radar.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p7\">Step out of your comfort zone. Speak up, share your opinions, and support other women. We all need each other to thrive and make a greater impact in our industry. Embrace LinkedIn posts, compose those emails to your boss—go for it, always. Diligence leads to success, but so does vulnerability and an open mind about your blind spots. Transform your knowledge into decisive actions; staying passive won&#8217;t take you far.</p>\r\n<h2 class=\"p10\">6.  Who do you admire in and outside of the supply chain?</h2>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">I hold admiration for several individuals, and among them is Sarah Barnes-Humphrey. She consistently puts herself out there, embracing her identity, and actively pursues her mission in the supply chain. Sarah is a positive force in the industry, striving for greater equality for women and empowering them to navigate life&#8217;s challenges and excel in their careers.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">Another remarkable individual is Sharon Siar, the driving force behind Saving Our Sisters. Sharon&#8217;s dedication to those in need is evident in her mentoring efforts and readiness to take on various roles within the industry. With over 30 years of experience in the supply chain, she not only imparts valuable knowledge but also recently established a non-profit offering counseling services to survivors of trafficking.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">Kristy Knichel, a second-generation business owner, has triumphed over numerous challenges. She has built a powerhouse of a company in Pittsburgh dedicated to lifting women, with a strong focus on achieving a balanced workforce. Kristy&#8217;s commitment extends to mentoring individuals, and her heart of gold shines through in all her endeavors. She has been a valuable teacher to me, and I am genuinely grateful for her shared wisdom and guidance.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\">Ellen Voie, the founder of Women in Trucking, is a trailblazer aiding women in transportation. Elevating awareness and implementing programs through her association, Ellen actively uplifts and encourages female drivers. Her dedication extends to educating young females about the diverse opportunities available to them in logistics.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p7\">I feel incredibly fortunate to have these inspiring women in my life. I extend my appreciation to countless others who, like ocean currents, are creating waves of positive change beyond measure.</p>\r\n<h2 class=\"p10\">7.  What have you learned on your supply chain journey so far and what’s next?</h2>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">So, this whole journey from working in logistics to being an exec and diving into entrepreneurship has been a real revelation for me. Having mentors around has been like gold—giving me the kind of feedback I need to keep getting better. One thing I&#8217;ve noticed is that I&#8217;m never quite satisfied, and while that might sound cool, it&#8217;s also a bit of a challenge. Imagine always wanting more, year after year.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p8\">I&#8217;ve had to admit to myself that I&#8217;m not great at slowing down and appreciating the little wins. You know, the stuff that adds up to the big picture, but you only see it when you look back. Answering these questions for the blog series has made me realize that this journey is always evolving. It&#8217;s a constant push to do better, and honestly, that&#8217;s what keeps me going. But it&#8217;s also about finding that balance—holding onto yourself, giving yourself room to breathe, and accepting that it&#8217;s okay to switch between running, walking, sprinting, and even crawling. It&#8217;s never a consistent sprint.</p>\r\n<h2 class=\"p10\">8.  What does your Women In Supply Chain™ feature mean to you?</h2>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">Being featured in the Women In Supply Chain™ Series fills me with pride, knowing that women are actively supporting each other in the dynamic realm of transportation and logistics. The strides we&#8217;ve made in this industry are significant, and our commitment to progress remains unwavering. By hearing the experiences and narratives of others, we can continue advancing.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\">I aspire for my story to serve as inspiration, encouraging fellow women to join me in my mission—whether within my organization, as entrepreneurs creating their own paths, or by boldly seeking promotions and career transitions. Reflecting on my journey, I acknowledge that sidestepping certain challenges could have propelled me further. Gratitude fills me as I recall the invaluable guidance from mentors who walked beside me, facilitating my learning and impact.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p7\">Through this article, I aim to share a glimpse of wisdom and hope. My wish is that it sparks positive changes and courageous leaps in the lives of others, fostering a community where women uplift and empower one another.</p>\r\n<h4> </h4>\r\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Calling all Women In Supply Chain™!!

    "content": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s a new year, and there are reasons to suggest that 2024 might be a departure from the fresh chaos that has hallmarked supply chain since the 2020’s started, or at least a de-escalation. Over the last few years, supply chain professionals have navigated an endless array of challenges. When managing logistics and supply chains, they’ve responded to global pandemic factory closures, volatile and spiking inflation, and geopolitical tensions including wars that have limited critical supplies—think grain from the Ukraine. More approaches to streamline a smart, sustainable supply chain are coming into focus this year—all made more possible by the growing ranks of Women In Supply Chain™.</span></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.apqc.org/blog/2024-predictions-supply-chain\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">APQC</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (American Productivity &amp; Quality Center) predicts that ESG and sustainability initiatives will be a driving factor across supply chain management, more organizations will move to digital supply chains, and inflation and labor shortages will continue creating SCM risks. At the end of the year, 616K skilled manufacturing jobs were still unfilled.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was a lot of</span><a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/supply-chain-leader-becky-simon-on-having-a-heart-of-service/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">progress for Women In Supply Chain™ last year</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with a huge increase in executive representation resulting in more opportunities for other female professions. Even while frontline representation by women stagnated at 31%, the overall percentage of women in the supply chain community made a 5% increase. This trend is expected to continue as more female professionals return to the post-Covid workplace.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To keep delivering new solutions and evolving with changing market demands, organizations need to invest in more Women In Supply Chain™.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> At Let’s Talk Supply Chain, we’re proud to feature Women In Supply Chain™ breaking outdated gender roles across global logistics, transportation, and manufacturing.

More than 70% rank the highest in customer satisfaction.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This month, we’re excited to feature</span><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/amandarichterkraft\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amanda Richterkraft</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a Logistics Sales Ops Team Lead at Trailer Bridge where she’s worked in a leadership capacity for almost five years. Amanda has a proven background in logistics coordination. She is an official Women In Supply Chain™ honoree.</span></p>\r\n<h3><strong><span style=\"font-size: 30px;\">1. Where did your supply chain journey start?</span></strong></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not to be cliché, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">but I started from the bottom and now I&#8217;m here</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">! I started in roles doing everything from sanitary services to coaching people through zipline courses in the Brevard Zoo, (in a male-dominated role where I found my voice and thrived). I picked up odds-and-ends jobs before dabbling in inventory management as a receiving specialist for a large grocery chain. Then I turned my sights to working in logistics directly. Now I find myself leading a team of 9-12 people at my home in logistics, Trailer Bridge Inc.</span></p>\r\n<h3><strong><span style=\"font-size: 30px;\">2. Have supply chain mentors helped your professional momentum?</span></strong></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My current direct manager, Steve, has been pivotal to my personal and professional growth. Steve, who has much more experience in the industry, has taken me under his wing to show me the ins and outs of supply chain. I&#8217;m able to have conversations with him where I feel included instead of talked at. He was instrumental in growing my confidence to get me to where I am in my career today.</span></p>\r\n<h3><strong><span style=\"font-size: 30px;\">3. What&#8217;s your experience working in a male-dominated industry?</span></strong></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It hasn&#8217;t always been easy. My first full truckload logistics job had a lot of toxic masculinity that made me question myself and my worth in the industry. At Trailer Bridge, my current employer, I feel like that a lot less.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would be lying if I said that there isn&#8217;t the occasional phone call or interaction with middle management that brings those feelings back like PTSD. But overall being in an environment that fosters love and respect for one another has allowed me to grow and feel that I do have worth in this industry.</span></p>\r\n<h3><strong><span style=\"font-size: 30px;\">4. When did you find your voice in your supply chain career?</span></strong></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Trailer Bridge we have a very intense leadership program focused on growing ourselves rather than our approaches to the business. During this time, I had the opportunity to rub shoulders with people who were more established or experienced. I found my voice when I realized that even more seasoned business members weren&#8217;t better or more equipped than me, they are my peers. I found more than my voice; I found my confidence to succeed during those weeks.</span></p>\r\n<h3><strong><span style=\"font-size: 30px;\">5. What advice do you have for Women In Supply Chain™ or others looking to start a career in the industry?</span></strong></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don&#8217;t let others put you down. It isn’t easy, but if you ever feel like you&#8217;re not being inspired to grow to your full potential, get out. Find someplace where people believe in you and your success. Be surrounded by people who give you the chance to learn and celebrate you as a member of this industry. If you&#8217;re not feeling love and respect then there is no reason to be there, anything that you would have gained from the time spent in these toxic environments will always cast a shadow over your personal and professional growth.</span></p>\r\n<h3><strong><span style=\"font-size: 30px;\">6. Who do you admire in and outside of supply chain?</span></strong></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our CEO at Trailer Bridge is an inspiration to me. He was one of the figureheads of a total change of attitude in what can be a rough and uncaring industry. When I mentioned earlier that our culture fosters love and respect, he is the one who not only inspires that culture but also keeps it growing.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would be remiss if I didn&#8217;t mention my mother here. She has lived in male-dominated industries, from lawn service to taxidermy, and she showed me the world in a different light while also showing how strong women can be.</span></p>\r\n<h3><strong><span style=\"font-size: 30px;\">7. What have you learned on your supply chain journey and what&#8217;s next?</span></strong></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All in all, the biggest thing I learned was to believe in myself. I&#8217;m still breaking down walls that I&#8217;ve constructed and I&#8217;m learning how to overcome my own imposter syndrome.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for the future, does anyone really know what it holds? My goal is to run my own office; I want to surround myself with people that I can inspire to grow more than they even believe they can. Whether I&#8217;m in my own office or my own business in the future, if I&#8217;m continuing to inspire and get to see those around me succeed I will be happy.</span></p>\r\n<h3><strong><span style=\"font-size: 30px;\">8. What does your Women In Supply Chain™ feature mean to you?</span></strong></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m honored to be a part of a growing trend of recognizing Women In Supply Chain™. I&#8217;m very surprised and delighted to be chosen to share my story especially when, in this industry, women don&#8217;t often share the spotlight.

    "content": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the year draws to a close, we can look back on all the progress Women In Supply Chain™ made this year and the powerful gains ahead. 2023 marks the year Women In Supply Chain™ returned to the post-pandemic workforce in full force. These advancements</span><a href=\"https://www.foodlogistics.com/professional-development/news/22866336/gartner-inc-26-of-supply-chain-csuite-roles-now-filled-by-women-gartner-study\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">turned heads at the C-suite and executive level</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. 26% of all executives, including CSO, SVP, EVP, and CPO positions, are filled by women—an all-time high up almost 20% from a year prior.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And while frontline representation by women remains stagnant at 31%, the overall percentage of Women In Supply Chain™ made a 5% increase. The trend is expected to increase as more female professionals continue to return to work.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Female representation in supply chain is continually increasing with business gender equity goals and initiatives since 2020. Supply chain programs and strategic roles have grown in response to disruptions and challenges and to better prepare for future ones. And all this stacks up because according to Gartner’s study, more women in executive leadership roles gives other female supply chain professionals more edge. So, we should expect to see another increase in the new year.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Momentum breeds momentum.  At Let’s Talk Supply Chain, we’re honored to highlight Women In Supply Chain™-shattering glass ceilings across global logistics, transportation, and manufacturing industries. Statistics show that</span><a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/category/women-in-supply-chain/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Women In Supply Chain™</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> drive faster, larger leaps forward, and greater profitability.

That’s why we highlight their breakthrough achievements and the experiences behind them every month.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s Talk Supply Chain’s Women In Supply Chain™ program, and these stories show business leaders that investing in their female workforce with room for career growth is a razor-sharp competitive advantage. Advancing women in your ranks is proven to propel higher revenue and ROI. Over half of businesses committed to gender diversity and equity have 50% higher profitability and 61% higher revenue growth than competitors. More than 70% rank the highest in customer satisfaction.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s Talk Supply Chain is committed to closing the remaining gender gap. We give the supply chain and logistics leaders shattering glass ceilings and gender barriers the recognition and visibility they deserve. Let’s Talk Supply Chain navigates professional roadblocks women leaders continually learn to navigate, how they empower each other, and how they transform business.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This month, we’re excited to feature</span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/beckysinclairsimon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Becky Simon</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, an employee engagement and training leader working with supply chain professionals. Becky is an Employee Engagement and Training Specialist at Trailer Bridge, recently recognized by Inc Magazine as one of the 5,000 fastest-growing private companies. Becky boasts a bachelor’s in marketing from Davis and Elkins College where she played on the women’s soccer team, and an MBA in Administration and General Management from Everest University in Jacksonville. Becky was also a recipient of the 2023 Women In Supply Chain™ award, presented by Food Logistics and Supply &amp; Demand Chain Executive.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through her leadership, Becky supports professional growth for others via instructional design, onboarding facilitation, training for soft skills, and public speaking. Her background in technology and</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">healthcare brings a versatile, results-driven approach to her work in supply chain.</span></p>\r\n<h3>1. Where did your supply chain journey start?</h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started in Talent Acquisition and love being a part of an employee&#8217;s &#8220;First Impression&#8221; of the company. One of the major Training activities I assist in is facilitating the New Employee Onboarding Experience (over two and a half business days) when they first onboard. I enjoy helping new folks understand the bigger picture of how their role supports their department, how their department contributes to the organization, and the role our company plays in the global supply chain.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 34px;\">2. Have supply chain mentors helped your professional momentum?</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My mentors believed in me before I believed in myself. They trusted me with opportunities that I wasn&#8217;t sure I was ready for so I could rise to the occasion. I process information by talking it out so having a trusted sounding board is incredibly valuable to me as a professional. I love learning from those around me and am fortunate to have several role models that I would classify as a mentor.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 34px;\">3. What’s your experience working in a male-dominated industry?</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I love it! Being a former athlete, extremely competitive, and a working mom, I know my skillset helps to fulfill a unique role as a woman and a professional. At Trailer Bridge, we believe our people are our greatest asset so approaching my role with a heart of service and as a caretaker for those coming into the company comes naturally.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 34px;\">4. When did you find your voice in your supply chain career?</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve always had a voice. Finding the right environment and leadership team that allowed me to be myself was key. There is no shortage of personality or enthusiasm in my approach to work. I&#8217;ve had previous experiences where I was told that I was &#8220;too much&#8221; or &#8220;too loud.&#8221; Finally, I&#8217;ve been unleashed to be myself and it&#8217;s wonderful.</span></p>\r\n<h3>5. What advice do you have for Women In Supply Chain™ and others looking to start a career in the industry?</h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bring your authentic self to work. As a wife, as a mom, and as a professional, I am the same person. Every role tugs at different traits. View yourself holistically and know that your story can inspire others.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Build and maintain your personal brand, that’s just as important as your expertise.</span></p>\r\n<h3>6. Who do you admire most in or outside of supply chain?</h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My kids. Living through the pandemic, it was refreshing to see their acceptance, resilience, and ability to evolve when the world around them shut down. I aspire to be like water and find a way around rocks in the river. It&#8217;s an incredible gift to steward their childhood and one that I deeply treasure.</span></p>\r\n<h3>7. What have you learned on your supply chain journey so far and what’s next?</h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;ve learned that I can craft the type of life I want. Whether that’s the way I show up each day, the hobbies I invest in, or the development of my skill set, I have a choice in what each new level looks like. It’s important to eagerly approach each new season and strive to make it better than the last.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would love to focus on more of the employee engagement and soft skills of becoming a well-rounded professional. Anyone can be taught logistics but what about the intangible characteristics of how you follow up, treat others, or resolve a conflict? I would want to make the most of that conversation and brainstorm together. Nothing excites me more than new ideas.</span></p>\r\n<h3>8. What does your Women In Supply Chain™ feature mean to you?</h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s such an incredible honor to be recognized alongside such influential and poised professionals. Being featured reassures me of the impact I&#8217;m helping to make within my organization and our industry. We have a responsibility to not only engage but train and invest in the people around us</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\r\n<h4> </h4>\r\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Calling all Women In Supply Chain™!!

    "content": "<p>Women In Supply Chain™ are gaining momentum in narrowing the gender gap. They now make up 41% of the supply chain workforce, an almost 40% increase from the year prior. Post-pandemic dynamics and more awareness of supply chains are empowering progress in what was once an overwhelmingly male-dominated industry. <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-06-29-gartner-says-26-percent-of-supply-chain-csuite-roles-now-filled-by-women#:~:text=The%20survey%20showed%20that%20women,2022%20(See%20Figure%201).\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">According to Gartner</a>, that trend is only increasing. More women are rejoining the supply chain post-pandemic and making gains in the upper echelons in roles as CSCOs, SVPs, EVPs, and CPOs. Women supply chain leaders currently comprise 26% of these roles, a historical 7% annual leap.</p>\r\n<p>Women have increased their presence in supply chain since the start of the decade, backed by business gender equality goals and DEI initiatives. Recent and ongoing disruptions have propelled the need for expanding the strategic logistics workforce with new supply chain programs and strategic roles with fresh opportunities for industry professionals. Gartner’s study shares that having more female representation in the supply chain leadership suite empowers other women to rise to executive leadership.</p>\r\n<p> At Let’s Talk Supply Chain, we’re dedicated to rallying behind Women In Supply Chain™ to shatter glass ceilings and gender norms across global transportation, manufacturing, and logistics industries.

Jennifer boasts a Bachelor of Science in Journalism from Ohio University and a Master of Business Administration from Capella University. In addition to her notable achievements as a thought leader and proponent of other Women In Supply Chain™, Jennifer is the Vice President of the Board for the Ohio Alliance to End Sexual Violence. She has served as a volunteer mentor for women in STEM.</p>\r\n<h3>1. Where did your supply chain journey start?</h3>\r\n<p>I started as a local newspaper community reporter and explored different roles and industries. I’ve worked in the industrial space as a journalist and a marketer. I love this space because there are endless stories and initiatives to share, often outside the mainstream media or viewpoint. As the Executive Director of the Transportation Marketing and Sales Association, I put my experience to work for members and the industry. I am constantly finding ways to support them in building a brand and reaching their already-inundated target audience.</p>\r\n<h3>2. Have supply chain mentors helped your professional momentum?</h3>\r\n<p>I&#8217;ve never had a formal mentor, but I have had people who have helped shape me professionally. When I was a reporter, my online manager showed me so much about digital marketing, Google Analytics, social media, etc. I never thought I would be anything but a journalist. I still love reporting on the side, but that web manager opened my eyes to marketing, and it’s become such a passion.</p>\r\n<h3>3. What’s your experience working in a male-dominated industry?</h3>\r\n<p>My ability to organize, drive initiatives, and meet deadlines increased my workload and level of responsibility without recognition or advancement. I was doing more and more work while needing to keep track of others.</p>\r\n<p>I&#8217;ve had men treat me poorly or “less than” because I am a woman. However, in each situation, there was a balance because my other male counterparts called out these behaviors as unacceptable. I stood my ground and found instead of tolerating inappropriate behavior.  </p>\r\n<h3>4. When did you find your voice in your supply chain career?</h3>\r\n<p>There were a few moments that brought out my voice. The first was when I worked with individuals who undervalued my work and made me question my own abilities. I wanted to work even harder to prove myself, and I put in the time, but it didn&#8217;t take me anywhere. I promised myself that I would drain every learning opportunity I could from that role, and when I moved on, I wouldn&#8217;t accept the same treatment.</p>\r\n<p>After leaving that job, it was easier to identify the type of colleagues and work environment. It&#8217;s been a progression in finding my voice.</p>\r\n<h3>5. What advice do you have for Women In Supply Chain™ and others looking to start a career in the industry?</h3>\r\n<p>Open your eyes to all possibilities. As a more creative person, I never thought about a career in supply chain or any other industrial space, but it&#8217;s where I found my calling. I&#8217;ve jumped from journalism to marketing to running TMSA—I would have never guessed my ultimate career path. I always wanted to prepare for the next step, whatever it was. Don&#8217;t be afraid to take on roles that scare you. Take the leap.</p>\r\n<h3>6. Who do you admire in the supply chain industry?</h3>\r\n<p> I admire many industry professionals. Kristy Knichel is the first one who comes to mind. She is an absolute powerhouse. I’ve enjoyed getting to know Kristy and learning from her.</p>\r\n<p>I&#8217;d be remiss not to mention my TMSA Board of Directors, who have greatly supported me. I respect how much they embraced the new leadership change and supported me through my transition from board member to Executive Director. I couldn’t appreciate these colleagues more, including Mark Derks, Tom Collins, Jill Schmieg, Holly LaBoda, Beth Malik, Courtney Keenan, David Hoppens, Blythe Brumleve, and many more.</p>\r\n<h3>7. What have you learned so far, and what’s next on your supply chain journey?</h3>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I’ve struggled with a serious case of imposter syndrome for years and tend to put my head down and do the work. I’m proud reflecting on what I&#8217;ve accomplished with TMSA over the past two years. I&#8217;ve learned that I am more capable than I thought. I try to give myself the space to savor the achievements now in a way I didn’t previously before moving on to the next challenge. I’m excited to continue making an impact for TMSA and our members across the Freight and Transportation communities.</p>\r\n<h4> </h4>\r\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Calling all Women In Supply Chain™!!

    "content": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The number of Women In Supply Chain™ is still rising, increasing 3 to 5% annually, now making up 41% of the industry. The recently overwhelmingly male-dominated industry is shifting and evolving. This decade has brought a greater understanding and awareness of how supply chains impact communities globally. </span><a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-06-29-gartner-says-26-percent-of-supply-chain-csuite-roles-now-filled-by-women#:~:text=The%20survey%20showed%20that%20women,2022%20(See%20Figure%201).\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Gartner</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, that trend is only increasing this year. More female professionals are rejoining the post-pandemic workforce and making gains across almost every leadership level–including C-level positions (CSCO, SVP, EVP, CPO). Today, Women In Supply Chain™ make up 26% of these roles, an unprecedented jump from 19% just last year.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The number of Women In Supply Chain™ has been increasing with business gender equality goals and initiatives since the start of the decade. Supply chain programs and strategic roles are also expanding in response to recent challenges and disruptions. Gartner’s study finds that more female C-suite leaders give other women momentum to achieve management and executive positions.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> At Let’s Talk Supply Chain, we’re passionate about empowering more Women In Supply Chain™ to break glass ceilings across global logistics, transportation, and manufacturing industries. The numbers don’t lie, and they show that</span><a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/category/women-in-supply-chain/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Women In Supply Chain™</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> spike faster, with larger leaps forward and advancements. They drive global business performance to unleash faster, smarter outcomes through greater collaboration. These Women In Supply Chain™ inspire us, and we hope they’ll motivate other female professionals looking to break the bold to keep going. That’s why we highlight their breakthrough achievements and the experiences behind them every month.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s Talk Supply Chain’s Women In Supply Chain™ program, and these blogs also show business leaders that investing in their female workforce with room for career growth is a powerful competitive advantage. Elevating women in your ranks is proven to propel higher revenue and ROI. Over half of businesses committed to gender diversity and equity have 50% higher profits and 61% higher revenue growth than competitors with less female leadership. Over 70% of these organizations rank the highest in customer satisfaction.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inflation, geopolitical tensions, and an ongoing talent shortage propel supply chain disruptions. Diversity in thought is no longer just necessary to remain competitive but also to stay in business. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s Talk Supply Chain is committed to closing the supply-chain remaining gender gap with more visibility around women supply chain and logistics leaders shattering glass ceilings and gender barriers with purposeful moves forward. Let’s Talk Supply Chain explores professional roadblocks women leaders continually learn to navigate, how they support each other, and how they transform business.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This month, we’re proud to highlight </span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/karinbursa/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Karin Bursa</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the Founder and Chief Executive Officer at </span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/nirakio/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NIRAKIO</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a B2B technology firm focused on supporting business growth and scalability. Karin is also a strategic advisor, a Fractional Chief Marketing Officer, and a TEKTOK Digital Supply Chain podcast host. She boasts over two and a half decades of supply chain technology experience and a proven strategic positioning, branding, segmentation, analyst relations, and lead generation track record. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Karin led strategic and marketing initiatives for Gartner Magic Quadrant and IDC MarketScape leader Logility. She has been hailed for her leadership with elite distinctions, including the Women In Supply Chain™ Award for the Supply Chain Pro to Know of the Year for 2020, and the 2009 Technology Marketing Executive of the Year. She also has been recognized as a Supply Chain Pro to Know for 2018, 2019, and 2020. Karin is a servant leader who has a history of sitting on forums and boards, including The Empty Stocking Fund, Kids in Need, the DBC Foundation, ASCM/APICS, and CSMP.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Where did your supply chain journey start?</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each job has driven me to solve supply chain challenges throughout my career, starting with the first accounting and inventory management system I helped implement for a local lumber yard at thirteen. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since then, my journey has led me to empower manufacturing companies and brand owners to enhance production line performance, inventory strategies, and S&amp;OP outcomes. These partnerships have improved customer experience, reduced inventory risk, and boosted profitability. With decades of supply chain and technology experience (and the battle wounds to prove it), I now act as an industry advisor and Fractional Chief Marketing Officer. I share my expertise with practitioners and technology providers. I help them focus on strategic information and meaningful motivation to transform businesses, unleash supply chain success, and mitigate inventory risks with valuable insights.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 34px; font-weight: 400;\">2. Have supply chain mentors helped your professional momentum?</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I never had a formal mentor. I did work for a male advocate who entrusted me with leading several visible projects. Approximately 80% of the workforce was male-dominated then, and I had the opportunity to work for a man who empowered me to stand out and make meaningful accomplishments. We would discuss strategy and tactics before he granted me full ownership over execution and outcomes. This working relationship was incredibly empowering and intimidating at times. He cleared a path for me to connect with other executives. More importantly, he treated me as an equal to my male peers. It marked a significant shift in my personal mindset.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 30px; font-weight: 400;\">3. What’s your experience working in a male-dominated industry?</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My experience as a woman in a historically male-dominated industry has been challenging and rewarding. For decades, I frequently found myself as the only woman in the room, often grappling with various forms of conscious and unconscious bias. I could share these experiences that could evoke laughter or even tears. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To succeed, I discovered the importance of having active dialogues, organizing my thoughts, and articulating a clear vision. Moreover, my listening skills and confidence in asking questions generated fresh opportunities and insights. Preparation makes you memorable, and over time I’ve transformed my ability to stand out into a professional advantage. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s heartening now to see more Women In Supply Chain™ with the ability to make substantial contributions and earn well-deserved recognition. But there is still work to be done. I hope to see equal progress for all professionals, based on their experience and expertise, not their gender or background.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 30px; font-weight: 400;\">4. When did you find your voice in your supply chain career?</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s been a personal journey and there are still moments when I grapple with imposter syndrome. It&#8217;s been an evolving process. My shift from corporate to the role of Chief Marketing Officer at Logility has been a career and life changer. Earlier in my career, my focus was on building a brand and a distinctive value proposition for my employers. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I became an entrepreneur and an Industry Advisor, I realized I needed to define my personal brand. It was uncomfortable to shift the conversation to focus on &#8220;me&#8221; and how I support clients in discovering better outcomes. But over time, it’s become more natural.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. What advice do you have for Women In Supply Chain™ and others looking to start a career in the industry?</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You deserve the opportunity to make an impact. Tackle hard projects. Be prepared. Take on high-visibility initiatives. View new technologies at every opportunity. Claim your space and lean into the conversation. And remember, if you don’t thrive with a corporate culture that feeds your soul and recognizes your contributions, look elsewhere. Your skills and experience are valuable, and it’s an exciting time to be in supply chain.  In supply chain, you can deliver tangible value. There are always new approaches to discover and room for growth and learning. Being a &#8220;problem solver” is a key fundamental to success. Build relationships by fostering collaboration with others across the business. Approach challenges from different angles with a focus on desired outcomes. It’s exhausting sometimes but rewarding when you see how you’ve driven value. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make your own path. Don’t follow in others’ footsteps. Do it your way. Owning our approach and working style always makes it easier and more satisfying in the end. Challenge yourself and see obstacles as opportunities to grow—never stop learning.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t be afraid to reach out and express your interest in having a mentor. I&#8217;ve found immense satisfaction in mentoring numerous supply chain professionals with serious potential at pivotal points in their careers and a few who are just starting. My hope is that my mentorship gives them an advantage that Women In Supply Chain™ didn’t have previously.  </span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. Who do you admire in the supply chain industry?</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I admire several supply chain professionals. It’s challenging to narrow down my list. Some happen to be among this year&#8217;s Women In Supply Chain™ honorees. I find inspiration watching &#8220;Shark Tank,” witnessing other entrepreneurs pitch their ideas and go-to-market strategies. It&#8217;s fascinating to see which ventures secure funding and from which investors. I&#8217;ve developed a genuine admiration for Barbara Corcoran. Her intelligence, approach, tenacity, and unique style serve as a constant source of inspiration for me to think bigger and take more risks</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7. What does your Women In Supply Chain™ award and feature mean to you?</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Receiving the 2023 Women In Supply Chain™ Award is a huge honor. It’s incredible witnessing the latest growth in female representation across supply chain sectors. While the award and feature are both a privilege, I hope it’s a call to action to motivate and empower other professionals of all genders to make their mark.  Together, we are reshaping the supply chain industry and its future.</span></p>\r\n<h4> </h4>\r\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Calling all Women In Supply Chain™!!

    "content": "<p>Working your way up in supply chain for a seat at the table may still not be simpler for women, even with growing market needs and challenges presenting new opportunities. <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/women-in-supply-chain/\">Women still make up less than half of the supply chain</a> workforce and just 21% of executive-level supply chain roles—backsliding a little from previous years. However, while Women In Supply Chain™ have more challenges breaking through to executive-level positions, female professionals (founders included) comprise 19% of the supply chain C-suite.</p>\r\n<p> At Let’s Talk Supply Chain, we’re passionate about helping more Women In Supply Chain™ blaze trails through glass ceilings across global logistics, manufacturing, and transportation. Studies show that <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/category/women-in-supply-chain/\">Women In Supply Chain™</a> spike higher levels of innovation—accelerating global business performance. These women inspire us; we hope they’ll inspire others to keep going. That’s why we share their stories every month.</p>\r\n<p>And we hope supply chain business decision-makers take notice also. Because promoting female professionals in your ranks is proven to generate higher revenue and customer satisfaction. Over half of businesses dedicated to gender inclusion and equity have 50% higher profits and 61% higher revenue growth than their peers with less female leadership. Over 70% of these companies lead in customer satisfaction.</p>\r\n<p>Inflation, geopolitical tensions, and an ongoing talent shortage continue propelling supply chain disruptions. Diversity in thought is no longer just necessary to remain competitive but also to stay in business.</p>\r\n<p>Let’s Talk Supply Chain is committed to closing the supply-chain gender gap by bringing more visibility around women supply chain and logistics leaders who are obliterating gender barriers and glass ceilings with purposeful career moves forward. Let’s Talk Supply Chain explores the obstacles women leaders continually learn to navigate, how they support each other, and how they are transforming the way we do business.</p>\r\n<p>This month, we’re proud to highlight <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/donnadelrosso/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Donna Del Rosso</a>, Senior Vice President of Transformation &amp; Planning at GXO Logistics, Inc. Donna has built her career at Fortune 500s and startups. She is passionate about building cohesive strategies to drive revenue and profitability, expand channels, and unleash an unparalleled customer experience. Donna boasts virtually three decades of industry and leadership experience and an MBA in General Business and Operations from Florida Atlantic University. She’s also earned a Rutgers University Certificate in Customer Experience Management and one from Georgia Institute of Technology for Global Supply Chain programs.</p>\r\n<h3>1. Where did your supply chain journey start?</h3>\r\n<p>I started as a dispatcher almost three decades ago—like everything supply chain—my career moved fast. I’ve been able to step into various leadership roles, and every new opportunity has been another step forward in my supply chain journey. A career path doesn’t have to be linear. Embrace change, even when it’s intimidating.</p>\r\n<p>One of the most valuable lessons I’ve learned is to surround yourself with exceptional people. I’m fortunate to work with incredible colleagues. We’re making big breakthroughs—together.</p>\r\n<p>The latest step in my journey in moving from Senior Vice President of Key Accounts to Senior Vice President of Transformation &amp; Planning has been a reawakening. It’s vital to approach every new role with an open mind and as an opportunity to grow personally and professionally.  I’m discovering new ways to help make GXO even more resilient, scalable, and growth-oriented. As the SVP of Transformation &amp; Planning, I work with over 400 global team members. Diversity in thought and collaboration is exceptionally rewarding.</p>\r\n<h3>2. Have supply chain mentors helped your professional momentum and opened a seat at the table?</h3>\r\n<p>Learning from others whom I respect—both personally and professionally—empowers me to grow as a leader and a person. I didn’t have a formal mentor relationship; early in my career, there was no LinkedIn or social media. I sought out colleagues to show me who and where the decision-makers were and what moved them.</p>\r\n<p>I leveraged meetings, conferences, and volunteer opportunities to build my network. Networking at these events opened otherwise hidden doors and accelerated my professional growth.</p>\r\n<h3>3. What’s your experience working in a male-dominated industry?</h3>\r\n<p>I was the only woman with a seat at the table for years. Understanding I couldn’t act like men made a difference for me in a male-dominated industry. I owned my identity and then, subsequently, my success. Being authentic makes amazing things happen. Forcing work dynamics and trying to be someone else isn’t comfortable or sustainable.</p>\r\n<p>By mid-career, I started seeing more diversity. The progress continues rapidly expanding at GXO. We see the results with the growing number of women in leadership roles backed by the organization’s commitment to DE&amp;I and promoting internally.</p>\r\n<p>I’m proud that half of our GXO board is female. Women should always research how many female leaders sit on a company’s board or in the C-suite to understand its commitment to gender diversity and the career advancement possible. At GXO, more inclusive leadership has improved decision-making and contributed to our organization’s overall success. A win-win.</p>\r\n<h3>4. When did you find your voice in your supply chain career?</h3>\r\n<p>When I reached my thirties, I could no longer try to be someone else to appease others. I realized that being <em>me </em>is enough. I was the Vice President of Logistics at a previous employer and had to figure that out or fail fast. I knew I needed to believe in myself for others to do the same. I couldn’t succeed professionally while trying to be someone I wasn’t.</p>\r\n<h3>5. What advice do you have for women in advocating for themselves and others in the supply chain?</h3>\r\n<p>Find your own direction. Don’t follow others. Seriously, do it your way. Make your career yours. Carving your own approach will always make it easier and better in the end. Challenge yourself and see obstacles as opportunities to grow—never stop learning.</p>\r\n<p>Get comfortable accepting personal and professional support from others, knowing that you’ll pay it forward one day. Everything comes full circle. Try to balance your spirit, your family, and your career; it’s possible when you love what you do. Be authentic. Be <em>you</em>, and you’ll be great.</p>\r\n<p>Again, vet out potential employers to see how many female leaders sit on their boards and their C and V-suites. You can usually find these details on company websites. This quick research helps you to understand business values, dedication to inclusion, and how much room you might have for advancement or if your professional growth could be limited by bias—conscious or unconscious.</p>\r\n<h3>6. Who do you admire in the supply chain industry?</h3>\r\n<p>I admire many people for different reasons. The “difference-makers” stand out the most—creating opportunities for others, questioning the status quo, and giving back to their families and communities. I am still in awe of Ruth Bader Ginsberg’s career and the legacy she left us with to honor and celebrate. She balanced her determination and family life and broke century-long barriers. Ruth opened doors for others for generations to come; that is her true legacy. She made a difference in millions of people’s lives, and she still inspires so many of us.</p>\r\n<h3>7. What have you learned so far, and what’s next on your supply chain career journey?</h3>\r\n<p> I’ve learned that investing in my personal and home life supports my career growth. It’s alright to accept help from others. I still struggle with asking for outside assistance, but I’m working to get better at it every day because I’ve learned that you don’t have to go it alone.</p>\r\n<p>Most women feel like they can’t ask for help. You can. Accepting help is OK; it’s how we bring more chairs to the table. I’m dedicated to supporting and mentoring other Women In Supply Chain™; it’s been a passion and a priority throughout my career.</p>\r\n<p>I meet tons of young women who are ridiculously talented but don’t always see opportunities or a path forward in the supply chain industry. This Women In Supply Chain™ recognition encourages me to continue identifying and guiding these exceptional Women In Supply Chain™. My goal is to help them reach their potential at GXO and in supply chain.</p>\r\n<p>I’ve had a great career so far. I never would’ve imagined I’d be here today or the journey that brought me here. I embrace what the future holds and see challenges as new opportunities. It’s all part of the adventure.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Network with more Women In Supply Chain™ like Donna. </strong>Unlock your supply chain success with Women In Supply Chain™!

Our blog series explores how these trailblazers contribute to their organizations and communities in a meaningful way. Let’s Talk Supply Chain explores the obstacles women leaders continually learn to navigate, how they support each other, and how they transform how we do business.</p>\r\n<p>This month, we’re honored to feature Erin O’Leary,  Chief Information Officer at Janel Group, Inc. Erin has a Master’s of Nonprofit Administration, Fundraising, Volunteer Management, and Administration from North Park University. She earned her nonprofit management certification through Harper College and her Bachelor’s in Environmental Studies from Northern Illinois University. For nearly two decades, Erin has spent her career making an impact in the nonprofit and supply chain sectors. She has held executive board positions with the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Dundee Township. </p>\r\n<h3>1. Where did your supply chain journey start?</h3>\r\n<p>My father recruited me into the industry. The company he was doing contract work for at the time needed a super user and administrator for the logistics platform they were implementing. It was an entry-level position, and although I had a bit of a tech background, I was utterly new to logistics and supply chain. </p>\r\n<p>From day one, I sat in the bullpen with the operations team for the freight forwarder I was working at. Not only was I learning the platform from scratch, but I was also learning the business and the industry simultaneously. I was very grateful for the operations team being so welcoming and answering all my (many) industry-related questions.</p>\r\n<p>I was determined that better understanding the industry and the business would make me a more successful IT person for the organization. Since then, I have grown through my several roles in IT. I went from performing administrator and basic help desk functions at a few organizations to eventually joining the leadership team for a mid-size freight forwarding and customs brokerage group. I still prioritize spending time on the business side of the house and sit with our operations teams to better understand what is happening in the business. That allows my team and I to collaborate and help develop impactful technology solutions. </p>\r\n<h3>2. How have your mentors helped you move ahead?</h3>\r\n<p>I have had many mentors along the way. Many individuals have supported me and believed in me, even when I haven’t believed in myself. One individual who has been vital over the years is Jen Parker.</p>\r\n<p>Jen is an incredible female leader in our industry who is the kindest, most intelligent, and hardest-working individual I have ever met. She believed in me when I doubted myself. She helped me navigate roadblocks and created tremendous opportunities for me. And not just me. She advocates for many others. Jen showed me that you can have a career and a family and succeed at both. She is truly an incredible person. </p>\r\n<h3>3. What’s your experience working in a male-dominated industry?</h3>\r\n<p>Honestly, it’s tough and can be a huge challenge at times. There seem to still be a lot of men in the industry from that truly male-dominated era, and some share the same biases and tendencies as they did five, ten, or 15 years ago. In many situations, I have often had to prove myself much more than a man would have to.</p>\r\n<p>Often, a male can give an opinion or decide on a process or something else for an organization without anyone thinking twice. Now, have a woman make that decision or opinion, and it may need to be validated with a significant amount of proof, evidence, and support from others. Things are still not equal, but I do see them improving.</p>\r\n<p>More women are at the table where decisions are made, and more women are now sitting in leadership roles supporting other women. We also now have men that support, mentor, and rally behind women, which is incredibly helpful. There is still much work to be done on this topic, though.</p>\r\n<h3>4. When did you find your voice in your supply chain career?</h3>\r\n<p>It happened over time. As I became more knowledgeable about the industry and technology, I became more confident when speaking with others. That confidence allowed me to contribute more in meetings and company projects and make recommendations. When I was recruited for a VP position at my current employer, Janel Group, I knew things were starting to come together, and I had an opportunity to make a more significant impact.</p>\r\n<h3>5. What advice do you have for women and others working their way up in supply chain?</h3>\r\n<p>Be confident in yourself and what you bring to the table. Don’t let anyone bring you down or try to challenge your worth or value. You must push hard and challenge the norm. Don’t take <em>‘that’s the way we’ve always done it</em>’ as gospel or the final answer. It is easy to struggle with imposter syndrome as you move up but know that if you are working hard and putting in the time and effort, you have earned it. You deserve it just as much, if not more, than anyone else.</p>\r\n<h3>6. Who do you admire in the supply chain industry?</h3>\r\n<p> I admire all the women and men in our industry who have started in an entry-level position with an organization, worked hard, and worked their way up to where they are today. It is so important to know the business inside and out. Starting from the bottom helps you understand the business and tap into that experience as you grow within the industry.</p>\r\n<h3>7. What have you learned, and what’s next on your supply chain career journey?</h3>\r\n<p>I am capable of more than I thought I was. If given a challenge, I won’t quit until I find a solution. Not every answer is going to be written out for you. Sometimes you have to figure it out as you go and remain patient and confident enough to allow that to happen.</p>\r\n<p>Next, I want to continue to pursue educational opportunities via courses, certifications, and industry-specific learning opportunities. I want to continue working towards maintaining a healthy work-life balance. Finding a healthy and maintainable balance can be a daily challenge, but it’s possible with planning and prioritizing. Last, I want to help grow the business for Janel Group by leveraging more technologies.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Meet Our Sponsor</strong></h2>\r\n<p>GoFreight is proud to sponsor the Women In Supply Chain™ blog and podcast series, recognizing women&#8217;s vital role in the industry and the need to highlight their contributions and experiences.

Where did your supply chain journey start?</h2>\r\n<p>I started on my sales and supply chain development path at Nestle UK, where I was a Demand Planning and Trade Promotion Planning Super User.

I project-managed different Supply Chain system implementations for Nestle across the continent and then led Nestle’s Silicon Valley Hub Supply Chain division—setting up supply chains and new business models with technologies to pilot.</p>\r\n<p>Driven to make a climate impact in my work, I moved to a plant-based seafood company to build its supply chain for the first product launch. I missed working in technology, and my passion for greener approaches took me to o9 Solutions where I bring best-in-class Supply Chain Planning and ESG tracking systems to market.</p>\r\n<h2>2. How have your mentors helped you move ahead?</h2>\r\n<p>I have been fortunate to have many mentors throughout my career transitions. They have all encouraged me to stay curious and focused. It’s tempting to say yes to everything; do everything. But my mentors remind me that I can make the most meaningful impact by strategically honing in on a few key areas.</p>\r\n<h2>3. What’s your experience working in a male-dominated industry?</h2>\r\n<p>There have been many positive changes over the years in recognizing women supply chain leaders and their achievements especially when it comes to Supply Chain Planning. At first, it was a challenge to have my voice and ideas heard. Fortunately, that dynamic has changed. Because we have to justify our decision-making more than our male counterparts historically, women are skilled in new technology adoption and data-driven practices. This commitment to precision and innovation can take our careers further.  </p>\r\n<h2>4. When did you find your voice in your supply chain career?</h2>\r\n<p>I had an aha moment when I was leading User testing for a Nestle USA Supply Chain software implementation. I was presenting the results to Senior leadership when I realized I understood so much about the end-to-end business. I knew the detailed nuances of end users in the supply chain and the big picture. I knew then that I could pinpoint the biggest supply chain challenges and anticipate how to solve them.</p>\r\n<h2>5. What advice do you have for women in advocating for themselves and others in the supply chain?</h2>\r\n<p>Make sure you remember to advocate for each other. Working together, women in any industry are an unstoppable force. I feel fortunate to be featured in the Women In Supply Chain™ blog series, especially because a female colleague nominated me. It’s an honor to be considered a leading woman in supply chain and have the visibility to shine the light on other female leaders.</p>\r\n<h2>6. Who do you admire in the supply chain industry?</h2>\r\n<p>Many Women In Supply Chain™ have a very quiet confidence about them. They don’t necessarily dominate meetings, but when they say something it’s impactful and drives action. Wendi Smith, who is the CSCO of Nestle USA is a strong woman supply chain leader who propels progress.</p>\r\n<h2>7. What have you learned so far and what’s next on your supply chain career journey?</h2>\r\n<p>I’ve realized that staying open-minded can take you far. Being curious and wanting to learn about supply chain elements and dynamics and how it all comes together can propel you ahead. Having a growth mindset and a thirst for hunger will take you to unimaginable places and positions you never expected.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Meet Our Sponsor</strong></h2>\r\n<p>GoFreight is proud to sponsor the Women In Supply Chain™ blog and podcast series, recognizing women&#8217;s vital role in the industry and the need to highlight their contributions and experiences.

With a Master of Business Administration MBA from LSU Shreveport and a Bachelor’s in Global Studies from Trinity College, she has put her knowledge to work solving internal operations and customer challenges. We applaud Chelsey as one of the female leaders we’ve recognized who recently broke into supply chain.</p>\r\n<h3>1. How did your supply chain journey begin?</h3>\r\n<p>My twenties were a lot of fun and struggle. I was searching for an AHA! moment that would help me find what to do with my life. I worked in film production, marketing, events, bartending, and construction, drove a snow plow, was a boss&#8217;s personal assistant, and engaged in a few pyramids&#8230; I mean “multi-level marketing” opportunities.</p>\r\n<p>I took a chance with a 9-5 job making 80+ cold calls a day, and it. was. thrilling. I was terrified and almost quit day one, but my team members popped into my gorgeous grey cubicle and let me know everyone sounds terrible on their first day. So, I stayed and learned. A lot.</p>\r\n<p>I was selling GPS and ELDs over the phone to businesses that didn&#8217;t expect my calls. With great coaching and hard work, I became tremendously skilled at it. I was at a really large company where I was required to stay in roles and take a certain path up the ladder. No jumping levels. That&#8217;s when I began looking at startups (you can google startup jobs, check out Wellfound, and even search startups on LinkedIn).</p>\r\n<p>SecurSpace was a three-person Charlotte startup solving the truck parking crisis. It was a hoot. We built all our tools from the ground up, designed processes, and made cold calls with what was a crazy idea at the time <em>(&#8220;Hey, let strangers pay to park in your lot!&#8221;</em>). It was challenging, frustrating, fun, and incredibly rewarding. SecurSpace was acquired by a hip little company called Envase. (Pronounced en-vah-say, fun to say).</p>\r\n<p>Headed by CEO Larry Cuddy, Envase was flying under the radar, acquiring crazy-cool technologies focused on the supply chain data black hole: DRAYAGE. Where would I fit in? These folks knew so much about trucking, and especially drayage.</p>\r\n<p>Over the last two and a half years, I gave myself some grace and learned as I went. My passion for growth helped me design the role I am in today, overseeing Marketing, New Business Sales, and Customer Success. Our team has been through a lot together figuring out how to smoosh nine companies into one powerful brand. It has been chaotic, frustrating, fun, and satisfying.</p>\r\n<p>Now Envase has been acquired by WiseTech Global, and I look forward to the new challenges and growth ahead.</p>\r\n<h3>2. How have mentors helped you gain career momentum?</h3>\r\n<p>My first mentor was through <a href=\"https://www.score.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SCORE Mentors</a>—a free program with leaders across specific specialties volunteering their time to help you learn more about different industries and reach your goals. I purposely sought out male Chief Revenue Officer mentors who could help me see where I may be letting my gender give me a complex. I learned how to present ideas and strategies (to bosses who weren&#8217;t expecting them) in a variety of ways. That was tremendously instrumental as I started working across multiple departments.</p>\r\n<p>At Envase, I have been fortunate to work with wonderful, talented professionals willing to take the time to mentor and guide me. I&#8217;ve learned how to get to the point without being too curt on calls. I&#8217;ve learned how to approach workplace confrontations in a healthy and diplomatic way.  I&#8217;ve found awesome books and podcasts to prepare you on how to pull teams from all walks of life to one team when to ask for help, when to shut up and listen (get curious before you get furious), and to just let it go. It takes work. I still pull from these lessons every day. Just a few of my favorite books include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Liz Wiseman’s <u>Multipliers: How the Best Leaders Make Everyone Smarter</u></li>\r\n<li>Susan Scott’s <u>Fierce Conversations: Achieving Success at Work and in Life One Conversation at a Time</u></li>\r\n<li>Mike Weinberg’s <u>Sales Management Simplified</u></li>\r\n<li>Don Miguel Ruiz’s <u>The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom</u></li>\r\n<li>Allan Dib’s <u>The 1-page Marketing Plan</u></li>\r\n<li>James Clear’s <u>Atomic Habits</u></li>\r\n<li>Tara Bush’s <u>Radical Acceptance</u></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>3. What’s it like to be a woman in a male-dominated industry?</h3>\r\n<p>I&#8217;m from a family of a few strong women surrounded by mostly gents. I&#8217;ve worked on teams with zero women (my job on a contractor&#8217;s crew, for example).  I wrestled on the boys’ team in high school. And I still struggled when I first joined the industry.</p>\r\n<p>Now I work on working and living by Ruiz’s iconic four agreements. If you aren’t familiar with them already, they are:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Be impeccable with your word</li>\r\n<li>Don’t take anything personally</li>\r\n<li>Don’t make assumptions</li>\r\n<li>Always do your best</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Ignoring one of <a href=\"https://www.miguelruiz.com/the-four-agreements\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the four agreements</a>, I <em>did </em>take things personally. Often. If someone cut me off in a meeting, I allowed myself to immediately root it back to my gender and fell into a rut of feeling small rather than living as the force that I am.</p>\r\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t always the industry or the people in the industry&#8230; the insecure feelings were usually (and some days still are) the stories inside my head. The stories we tell ourselves can be dangerously powerful. I have awesome coaches, mentors, and a therapist who have helped me slowly reshape this mind of mine to handle any industry, anytime.</p>\r\n<h3> </h3>\r\n<h3>4. When did you find your voice in supply chain?</h3>\r\n<p>I&#8217;m still finding it. At one point, I got tired of feeling angry, frustrated, and victimized. I went to therapy, and I went back to graduate school.</p>\r\n<p>Over the last few years, I&#8217;ve been introducing mini (some might say atomic) habits into my life to get healthier, be nicer to myself, and focus less on the gloom-and-doom stories that still occasionally pop into my head.</p>\r\n<p>I won&#8217;t be done growing any time soon, but you&#8217;ll notice the growth in my tone of voice when I start really being a friend to myself again.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>5. Who do you admire in supply chain or outside of it?</h3>\r\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure there is a harder-working person than Danny over at Harbor Division. I haven&#8217;t had the privilege of working with him in a while, but I remember him leaving it all on the field every day and taking great care of his team and his customers. You can&#8217;t teach that level of caring.</p>\r\n<p>On the Envase team, we have a few rising stars in the mix. Jessica Whitehouse has a ridiculously expansive knowledge of the industry, tackles each role with endless energy, and keeps teams motivated to do their best. Rather than hoarding her experience, Jessica is an expert willing to share her knowledge and teach others around her.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>6. What advice do you have for women in advocating for themselves and others in supply chain?</h3>\r\n<p>Be kind. To yourself first, then others. Be curious and ask questions. It&#8217;s OK not to have everything figured out now, or ever. We all keep growing and changing.</p>\r\n<p>Don&#8217;t quit a job where you enjoy the work you are doing out of frustration with people or processes—reach out for help first from a mentor, HR, or someone on LinkedIn. I left a few really cool jobs because I didn&#8217;t know how to emotionally handle a bully or a silly process.</p>\r\n<p>If there isn&#8217;t a role at your company that checks these boxes for you, then try to create it for yourself. You can be great at it, enjoy it, and bring your company more value.</p>\r\n<h3>7. What have you learned so far and what’s next on your supply chain career journey?</h3>\r\n<p>Hustle beats talent if talent doesn&#8217;t hustle. But I can only hustle if I am genuinely invested in the work I&#8217;m doing. Sometimes you need to listen to people who tell you to take a vacation and hustle less.</p>\r\n<p>Movement and Action are not the same things. I have a strong dislike for movement without action, (planning something but never doing it).</p>\r\n<p>It&#8217;s more than O.K. to say no to meetings, projects, and responsibilities that don&#8217;t fit into your path, (I <em>Marie Kondo&#8217;d</em> my workweek).</p>\r\n<p>There&#8217;s a time and place to let your survival mode brain kick into high gear&#8230; it usually doesn&#8217;t need to be turned on at work (no tigers are going to eat you). This one is tough, but I&#8217;m gradually getting there.</p>\r\n<p>The Future? I love learning, building processes and tools, failing, learning, and trying again. I reckon I&#8217;ll keep doing that.</p>\r\n<p>The first area I want to focus on is continuing to have a positive impact on the industry. I&#8217;ve learned that even a small change can make a huge difference and improve someone&#8217;s day, which can be incredibly fulfilling. Next, I want to make sure I am continuing to build relationships that can offer support, guidance, and valuable connections to bring everyone closer and facilitate more collaboration. Lastly, I hope to attract more people to the supply chain industry. Now that I don&#8217;t need to explain to anyone what Supply Chain is (thanks Covid!), I hope to be a mentor for those looking to launch and continue their career in the industry.</p>\r\n<h3>8. What does being featured in the Women In Supply Chain™ series mean to you?</h3>\r\n<p>Being featured in the Women In Supply Chain™ series is an honor and a phenomenal platform to share my story. I&#8217;m relatively new to the logistics industry, and I still have the feeling in meetings of &#8220;What is that acronym again?!&#8221;.</p>\r\n<p>I&#8217;d like to show that learning never stops, and just because you may not understand the ins and outs of supply chain today doesn&#8217;t mean you should avoid it. It is a fun industry, and there are supportive folks willing to say &#8220;That acronym means ______&#8221; without judgment, so don’t be afraid to ask questions and dig in for more details.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Meet Our Sponsor</strong></h2>\r\n<p>Women fuel the success of some of the world’s most successful businesses, yet barriers still exist.

She earned a Leadership Development Program certificate from the Stanford University Graduate School of Business and achieved Business Administration and International Business degrees in Finance and Accounting from the University of Colorado Boulder.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>1. How did your supply chain journey begin?</h3>\r\n<p>Believe it or not, I started my career as a bunker broker in Valparaiso, Chile. Working as a broker was an incredible opportunity because I could fully submerge myself in a new culture, travel the world, and understand the operational challenges we face in logistics and supply chain firsthand.</p>\r\n<p>From there, I was recruited to lead the Americas sales team for a UK-based company, which focused on digitizing shipping documentation. Gaining a deep understanding of the operational challenges in logistics and leveraging my expertise in technology and digitization brought me to my current home, Blume Global, a WiseTech Company, and a leading global supply chain company.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>2. How have mentors helped you gain career momentum?</h3>\r\n<p>I have had several amazing mentors throughout my life, but the one that always comes to mind is Paula DeMasi, a senior finance executive at Phillip Morris International. When I was 13 years old, and asked her if I could be her pseudo-daughter for Bring Your Daughter to Work Day. I remember putting on my suit, taking the 6 a.m. ferry from New Jersey to New York, and her handing me a pen a paper to take notes while I &#8220;interviewed&#8221; her boss and their supervisor throughout the day.</p>\r\n<p>Participating in events like Bring Your Daughter to Work Day can be a powerful way to inspire and encourage young people, especially girls, to pursue careers in fields that they may not have considered. Having her as a mentor was valuable because she gave me access to knowledge, experience, and insights I might not have otherwise.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>3. What’s it like to be a woman in a male-dominated industry?</h3>\r\n<p>Asking about gender-disparity-driven challenges is always a loaded question, and I have stories to share. However, I always say that just having that seat at the table is critical. It allows you to have a say in the decisions and advocate your ideas and perspectives. I&#8217;ve found that diversity of thought and perspective is essential for innovation and success. I continually speak up and share my ideas to break down barriers and pave the way for more women and other underrepresented groups to succeed. So make sure you are at the table.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>4. When did you find your voice in supply chain?</h3>\r\n<p>I found my voice when I lived abroad in South America. My Spanish wasn&#8217;t excellent when I first moved there, and it was incredibly humbling to learn to communicate. I&#8217;ll never forget the first time I answered the phone, took my first sales call, and made my first presentation in Spanish. All of them went well. After I tackled that milestone—anything in English was a breeze.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>5. Who do you admire in supply chain or outside of it?</h3>\r\n<p>I had the privilege to meet Kate Guttman a few years ago when I attended an intimate UPS round table event. Kate has shattered glass ceilings at UPS in every role she has taken over the last 30 years and received numerous honors for her contribution to our industry. After we met, I received a UPS package filled with UPS-brand goodies for my young son at my front door. It was heartwarming to know that as senior as she was in this enormous organization, she takes the time to connect with individuals to make a small impact in their lives. It&#8217;s a great reminder that success is about what we achieve and our impact on the people around us. It speaks to her leadership style and values, and I hope to be that kind of leader someday.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>6. What advice do you have for women in advocating for themselves and others in supply chain?</h3>\r\n<p>First, be curious and willing to learn. The industry constantly evolves, and there is always something new to discover. Take the time to research and learn about the different aspects of the industry, including logistics, transportation, and technology.</p>\r\n<p>Second, build your network. Attend industry events and conferences, connect with industry leaders and experts on social media, and join professional organizations. These connections can provide valuable insights and opportunities for career advancement.</p>\r\n<p>Third, be confident in your abilities, and don&#8217;t be afraid to take risks. The industry needs more diverse perspectives and innovative ideas, so don&#8217;t hesitate to share your thoughts and opinions.</p>\r\n<p>And finally, seek out mentors and role models. Find people who inspire you and can offer guidance and support as you navigate your career. And remember that success is about achieving your goals and positively impacting the world around you.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>7. What’s next on your supply chain career journey?</h3>\r\n<p>Over my supply chain journey, I have learned that my work significantly impacts me. While I think the DCSA eBL commitment should have happened years ago, I am thrilled that by 2030 we will finally accomplish that. Seeing the progress and industry commitment toward digitization validates my work and encourages me to help people innovate. On a personal note,  I also hope my future includes mentoring more women to return to work. Covid left so many of my close friends in an impossible position with childcare, and these brilliant minds with MBAs and PHDs left the workplace. I know how difficult this decision was then, and I want nothing more than to help these intelligent women find ways to come back and continue to contribute to this fantastic industry.</p>\r\n<p>The first area I want to focus on is continuing to have a positive impact in the industry.   I&#8217;ve learned that even a small change can make a huge difference and improve someone&#8217;s day, which can be incredibly rewarding and fulfilling.</p>\r\n<p>Next, I want to make sure I am continuing to build relationships that can offer support, guidance, and valuable connections to bring everyone closer and facilitate more collaboration.</p>\r\n<p>Lastly, I hope to attract more people to the industry. Now that I don&#8217;t need to explain to anyone what Supply Chain is ( thanks Covid!), I hope to be a mentor for those looking to launch and continue their career in supply chain.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>8. What does being featured in the Women In Supply Chain™ series mean to you?</h3>\r\n<p>Being featured in the Women In Supply Chain™ series means so much to me. I fiercely advocate for inspiring and empowering other women to pursue their careers. I think it is so vital to raise awareness of the gender disparities that exist and to highlight the contributions that women make in the workplace.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Meet Our Sponsor</strong></h2>\r\n<p>Women fuel the success of some of the world’s most successful businesses, yet barriers still exist.

How did you start your journey in supply chain?</h4>\r\n<p>Nearly three decades ago, my first supply chain industry role allowed me to transition from the food service industry, moving me into a ‘graveyard’ shift with very little training and no mentorship. Soon after, I worked hard as a single mother to advance to the daytime position and continue learning and growing in my career. There were a lot of struggles along the way and minimal support in my role.</p>\r\n<p>In time, I was a married mother of two, still struggling to advance in seniority as a woman in the industry. I left and went back to school to learn computer programming. Going back to school as a mother of two, maintaining a job, and marriage was exhausting.</p>\r\n<p>When I graduated, I took my new skill set back to the industry and joined a brokerage with an in-house programming team. It was rare to find a brokerage looking to build tech in the supply chain industry at that time, and I was excited to be a part of it. My passion for pairing industry expertise with building new solutions took my career in a new direction.</p>\r\n<p>The unfortunate part of our industry is that we haven’t done a great job of establishing career paths and mentorship. I continued to work hard at creating those opportunities for myself. Often this meant that the only way to advance your career was to move on to another employer. I continued to build, innovate and advance—seeing so much potential for the future. I felt the industry was moving too slowly, especially as a woman in a leadership position.</p>\r\n<p>Eventually, I met my future business partner, Syl, through mutual friends. She was actively working with start-ups in the FinTech world. The more we talked about the industry, the more interested we both became in building something new that would be a game-changer for logistics. We got off the ground quickly and made progress every day. In less than two years, Community Customs Brokers had won business, notoriety, and attention across the country. By the Spring of 2019, we’d received three offers to purchase our business from other brokers and freight forwarders—including a silicon valley unicorn.  </p>\r\n<p>It was a wild ride, and ultimately we decided that the offer from Flexport (the U.S.-based unicorn) aligned most closely with the vision we had for the future. We agreed to sell and join forces in the Summer of 2019. That is just the beginning of the story.</p>\r\n<h4>2. Have you had mentors or colleagues you admire in or outside of the supply chain community?</h4>\r\n<p>A few individuals stand out in my career as people who have helped shape my professional goals. It is an honor to mention them here. They have all since retired, and I hope they are enjoying every piece of it—they earned it.</p>\r\n<p>Annette Thompson provided education and resources that were pivotal in my career growth. As another woman in business, she focused on empowering others to advocate for themselves. Knowing that women had a steeper hill to climb, Annette always pushed to ensure that whatever case you were making, you had the ability to find and use the legislation or historical case logic to support your argument.</p>\r\n<p>Frank Robles was a powerhouse of Canadian customs clearance knowledge. The kindness and truth that he shared with me was invaluable. Frank’s character and willingness to engage in mentorship helped to shape the confidence and resilience I needed to become a strong leader for others.</p>\r\n<p>Linda Moore defines a strong woman in business. Linda’s fortitude and strength to get the job done was a powerful representation of where I wanted to go with my own career. Her ability to engage with the old guard and to be seen, heard, and respected in that arena was and is still a huge accomplishment.</p>\r\n<h4>3. Tell us about what it&#8217;s like to be a woman in a male-dominated industry:</h4>\r\n<p>It’s been challenging to navigate the &#8220;old boys club&#8221; in a way that makes space for your growth, without trying to be one of “the boys.” It creates a very fine line to walk. I felt welcome in certain spaces but ostracized in others.</p>\r\n<p>Fortunately, it is changing. There are notable differences now from even a decade ago. At that time, I was often the only woman in the boardroom, and being heard was a challenge. Attending TPM2023 this year, meeting Sarah from Let’s Talk Supply Chain, and many other wonderful women of industry was incredibly rewarding. It was refreshing being in the same room with other female founders, leaders, and executives. I love that Women In Supply Chain™ puts a spotlight on this growing group of successful professionals.  </p>\r\n<h4>4. When did you find your voice in supply chain?</h4>\r\n<p>There were a few events over the years where I found my voice—starting in a vulnerable place in my life—as I have learned from people and experiences. I have welcomed a stronger and more vibrant, internal voice. I’ve also learned a lot along the way:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>I am stronger than I ever thought I could be when I started</li>\r\n<li>I am capable of things that I am yet to discover</li>\r\n<li>I must do the boring tasks first</li>\r\n<li>I will always be engaging in learning</li>\r\n<li>I know that every hour of preparation I put into something will pay off exponentially</li>\r\n<li>I could not succeed without the people in my life</li>\r\n<li>I have a responsibility as a leader to lift others up</li>\r\n<li>I respect that my own humility must be acknowledged and shared</li>\r\n<li>I need a tidy workspace, it makes me more productive</li>\r\n<li>I love remote work</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>5. Who do you admire in supply chain or outside of it?</h4>\r\n<p>On a personal level, hands down, I admire my Dad. He has been an entrepreneur since the 70s and has built and sold many businesses over the decades. His drive, common sense strategies, and business ethics have been and always will be the foundation for my success. He never held back on giving me or my sisters&#8217; opportunities because we were girls. Instead, he always encouraged us. We could do it better <em>because we were girls</em>.</p>\r\n<p>To this day, he is still the first person I rely on for business advice and I cherish his insight whenever we talk.</p>\r\n<h4>6. What advice do you have for women in advocating for themselves and others in supply chain?</h4>\r\n<p>Taking a leap into the unknown is never easy. If you aren’t scared, you should be. However, with really good planning, connecting with others in the community for support and mentorship, and diving into the &#8220;I-don&#8217;t-know-what-I-don&#8217;t-know&#8221; realization, you are more capable of handling the unknowns as they arise.</p>\r\n<p>Networking is more valuable than you realize. Reach out to as many people who have come before you as you can, and don&#8217;t be discouraged when you are not acknowledged by all of them. A select few will be there and will be excited for you.</p>\r\n<h4>7. What’s next on your supply chain career journey?</h4>\r\n<p>Currently, I have plans that are beginning to transition into my new reality and that is very exciting. xGlobl Inc. is my newest North American start-up. I have again partnered with Syl Urbanoski. We have grand goals for this venture and have already begun to put pieces into place that will allow us to drive our vision into a product that will be unlike any other in the industry. The amazing team of experts we are working with, along with a fierce appetite to see our vision come to life is incredible. I cannot wait to be able to share, however, we are keeping our plans confidential until we are ready to go live.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 id=\"about-the-author\">About the Author</h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:post-content -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"left\",\"id\":7115,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\r\n<figure class=\"alignleft size-full\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-14092\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NSW-300x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NSW-300x300.png 300w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NSW-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NSW-150x150.png 150w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NSW-768x768.png 768w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NSW-600x600.png 600w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NSW-100x100.png 100w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NSW.png 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></figure>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- /wp:image -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Naomi Sylvian is a content marketing leader with more than 17 years of experience, and the editor of Let’s Talk Supply Chain’s Women In Supply Chain™ series.

How did you start your journey in supply chain?</h4>\r\n<p>  My career trajectory was different—I fell into Supply Chain. I started out in Human Resources as an HR Payroll Clerk for a Petroleum Company. Human Resources provided a sense of fulfillment, I enjoyed helping people fulfill their potential, hiring the right applicants to fit the right jobs, and empowering them to thrive in their roles.  HR as a profession allowed me to express my personality, talking to diverse groups of people and working across recruitment, payroll, compensation, and professional development.  Then things shifted, and I started to feel like the work I was doing was becoming more transactional and less transformative.  I wanted to bring meaning or value to my work and organization, and this was my “Ah Ha” moment it was time to find another career path where I could transfer my skills while elevating my experience to reach my full professional potential. I decided to explore other internal opportunities. A Procurement Analyst position was posted, and I said “Wow, what better way to learn more about a Petroleum Company than through a procurement position on the Refinery side of the business.”  I interviewed and was offered the position as a Procurement Analyst— jumpstarting my Supply Chain Management career. I found a career path forward that I could grow in and more importantly, use my voice to bring value to the work and organization.  The transition was challenging and rewarding at the same time. Making the decision to move from HR into Supply Chain Management wasn’t easy.  This transition helped me get comfortable with being uncomfortable and opening myself up to learn about the company through a different lens.  Both professions are my passion.  With over 20 years of professional experience spanning private and public sectors in Pharmaceutical, Petroleum, Chemical Manufacturing, Private Real Estate, and Utility industries, my professional experiences include Business Management, Business Administration, Human Resources, Supply Chain Management, and Supplier Diversity.  I have 15 years of experience directly in Supply Chain Management—Purchasing, Warehousing, Operations, Contract Services, Strategic Sourcing, Supplier Relationship Management, and Supplier Diversity. I have grown and love what I do, it feels transformative, and that gives me a sense of reassurance that Supply Chain Management and Supplier Diversity is where I belong. Over the years, I have received recognition and honors for my hard work, dedication, commitment to excellence, leadership, and exemplary contributions to the profession of Supply Chain Management and Supplier Diversity. My educational background keeps me close to Human Resources and Supply Chain Management from a holistic approach. I successfully defended my dissertation on “Leader-Follower Perceptions of Servant Leadership Trainings in Municipal Organizations” in April 2020. I earned my Doctor of Management (DM) degree in Management and Organizational Leadership.  Furthermore, I hold a Master’s degree in Management (MM) and a Master of Arts in Organizational Management (MAOM) all from the University of Phoenix.  My Bachelor of Science (BS) is from Penn State University in Business Management. My experience and passion for both Supply Chain Management and Management and Leadership Development have enabled me to motivate my team during difficult times of the pandemic, civil unrest, and ongoing supply chain disruptions.  </p>\r\n<h4>2. Have you had mentors or colleagues you admire in or outside of the supply chain community?</h4>\r\n<p>  Mentorship was instrumental during the trajectory of my career, it’s key to professional and personal development. A mentor is someone who can help you grow your skills, make better decisions, and gain valuable career and life insights.  I have been fortunate to have mentors since my high school, undergraduate, and postgraduate studies. As my career developed, I learned that one mentor wasn’t enough. I needed to expand my horizons and have a personal and professional “board of directors”. In the early phases of my career in Supply Chain Management, I developed a mindset to think of myself as a business-of-one and my board consists of a mentor, advocate, champion, friends/peers (sounding board), and coach. Each person on my board is instrumental in my brand, focus, and motivation personally and professionally.  As a female in Supply Chain Management having diverse perspectives is essential in this field.  </p>\r\n<h4>3. Tell us about what it&#8217;s like to be a woman in a male-dominated industry:</h4>\r\n<p>  Male-dominated industries can reinforce harmful stereotypes and create toxic environments that make it even more difficult for women to excel. Female professionals like me face significant challenges working in a male-dominated industry, including imposter syndrome, societal expectations and beliefs that women&#8217;s leadership abilities are sub-par, unfair pay gaps, gender discrimination, added pressure of working under a microscope, and/or the assumption women don&#8217;t understand how to do the job.  These are still harsh realities today.  As an African American female working in a historically male-dominated industry, I used to be worried about my male peers taking me seriously or would I just be a voiceless female in the room taking notes. I never knew what imposter syndrome was until later on in my career when I learned through mentorship, training, and self-perseverance to own my own power. Now, I know how to take control of what I want versus what I do not want. I show up as my authentic self—freeing my voice. I’ve learned in practice how to be transformative by being part of the solution and not the problem, and continue to always be a sponge—never stop learning, growing, and thinking strategically.  This mindset has helped me lead with humility, passion, drive, focus, and innovation.  Every woman in her career reaches a point when she knows they are not needed to just take notes but to take charge. My motto is, &#8220;If there is no room for me at the table, I will bring my own chair or table.”  </p>\r\n<h4>4. When did you find your voice in supply chain?</h4>\r\n<p>  I’ve always had a strong internal voice, but it was a while before I was ready to make my voice heard. As a female in a male-dominated industry, I made mine heard when I found confidence in my work. I realized the value I bring to the table because the work is my passion. I learned how to move from working as an admin taking notes in meetings to engaging in the dialogue that was unfolding around me—eliminating my imposter syndrome for good. I knew I belonged in the role, but more importantly, I knew I belonged in the room with my peers. During my career trajectory and even today, my voice will be heard. We will never be heard or bring change if we remain silent.  </p>\r\n<h4>5. Who do you admire in supply chain or outside of it?</h4>\r\n<p>  I admire Indra Nooyi, a businesswoman and former Chief Executive Officer and Chairperson at PepsiCo. She is an Indian-American woman who is powerful, empowering, motivating, and believes in creating a vision and unleashing the momentum of her people. She represents a true Servant and transformative Leader. Indra’s career path and story are amazing. I admire women who are strong (despite all odds), strategic thinkers, and risk-takers, who know their voice matters and can bring change no matter the odds or obstacles. Indra is a huge personal, and professional inspiration.  </p>\r\n<h4>6. What advice do you have for women in advocating for themselves and others in supply chain?</h4>\r\n<p>  Always remain true to yourself, and never be afraid to say no, and break barriers. Stay open to change. Don’t be afraid to be unapologetic, and always know your worth. Last, always lift up and empower other women—straighten their crowns and yours. My two favorite quotes to live by are: &#8220;You meet people where they are, to bring them where they need to be.” From Dr. Michael Dyson. And, &#8220;Good, Better, Best, never rest until your good is better and your better is best,” by Dr. Shawn Boone.  </p>\r\n<h4>7. What’s next on your supply chain career journey?</h4>\r\n<p>  The future is very bright for Dr. Erica Patterson, this journey isn’t over. I’ve learned to say no more and stay positive. I am working towards becoming an Adjust Professor, teaching is another passion. I’m also on track for a promotion to Vice President. And lastly, I’m ready to travel—I’m thinking Dubai, Paris, or Greece, all the beautiful places I want to explore.  </p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 id=\"about-the-author\">About the Author</h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:post-content -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"left\",\"id\":7115,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\r\n<figure class=\"alignleft size-full\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-14092\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NSW-300x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NSW-300x300.png 300w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NSW-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NSW-150x150.png 150w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NSW-768x768.png 768w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NSW-600x600.png 600w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NSW-100x100.png 100w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NSW.png 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></figure>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- /wp:image -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Naomi Sylvian is a content marketing leader with more than 17 years of experience, and the editor of Let’s Talk Supply Chain’s Women In Supply Chain™ series.

    "content": "<p>It&#8217;s a new year, and Bloomberg has already <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-12-20/supply-chain-latest-predictions-for-2023\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">coined it the 2023 hangover</a> for supply chain leaders. Because professionals across the global chain are still rebalancing inventory levels and offshoring strategies after the start of the decade, hallmarked by unprecedented chaos that pushed the supply chain front-and-center for business leaders and consumers. U.S. Secretary of Transportation, former Southbend Mayor, and a previous presidential candidate, Pete Buttigieg has been keeping a vital drumbeat in the media and on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SecretaryPete/status/1600281782167179264?cxt=HHwWgMDU6avzq7UsAAAA\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">his personal Twitter feed</a> around the importance of a resilient supply chain workforce. Never in modern history have supply chain leaders had more visibility, vulnerability, or accountability laid squarely at their feet. And even with global downturn and anticipated economic stagnancy, and lower shipping container volume, supply chain disruption—fueled by climate events, changing ESG regulations, evolving consumer expectations, and other geopolitical tensions are an industry constant. &#8220;Hangover&#8221; might be the perfect summation of the exhaustion and burnout across the global supply chain and logistics community. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90799235/6-trends-global-supply-chain-2023\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">new challenges</a> are still coming painfully into focus. Climate change is driving additional obstacles, and government intervention in ESG planning after recent research found countries everywhere need to catch up on emissions goals. The UN is still pushing governments globally to set new goals and make deeper cuts to counter the highest temperatures <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/16/return-of-el-nino-will-cause-off-the-chart-temperature-rise-climate-crisis\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">on record predicted for later this year</a>. Diversity in leadership and approaches has never been more important for supply chain.   And according to the experts, gender diversity specifically is an often overlooked investment. <a href=\"https://www.onlinemba.com/blog/why-women-make-better-business-leaders/#:~:text=Women%20also%20pull%20ahead%20in,inclusion%20(DEI)%20as%20well.\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Harvard Business Review</a> cites that women in business score higher than male counterparts in key leadership areas like resilience and solutions-driven acumen, teamwork, and decisive leadership. At Let&#8217;s Talk Supply Chain™, we think every business can identify smarter outcomes when more diverse voices are in the mix. We&#8217;re dedicated to closing the supply-chain gender gap by bringing more visibility around female trailblazers in the logistics community who are making unapologetically bold moves and breakout career advancements. Each month our <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/women-in-supply-chain/wisc-blog/\">Women In Supply Chain™</a> blog series brings you the latest woman leaders and influencers so you can hear how they are making waves across the supply chain and bringing new solutions.

Tell us about your journey in supply chain:</h4>\r\n<p>  Years ago, when I graduated from college, I was part of a business management training program—putting my logistics skills to work in a warehouse in Atlanta. My day started at 4:30 a.m., scheduling trucks and warehouse operators until the shift change at 3 p.m. when my management training started. I&#8217;d go home and crash around 8:00 until it started again the next day. It was grueling, but what I love about logistics is the &#8216;puzzle&#8217; you assemble (and then re-assemble) almost hourly. I found my passion for technology when I started programming in the warehouse to make my work life (and all our employee lives) simpler. Then I went to work for a data research firm in the Consumer Products industry to leverage my Marketing degree, where I realized how much data and analytics can help inform smarter business decisions. Fast forward to an 18+ year career at SAP and while I am still putting puzzle pieces together, now it&#8217;s on a much larger scale. I&#8217;m managing more than just warehouse operations. I am responsible for marketing SAP&#8217;s entire portfolio of solutions across the end-to-end supply chain from designing, planning, manufacturing, delivery, and operations. I get to lead a team of fantastic talent who sit around the world and connect with leaders across functions (i.e., Solution Management, Development, Operations, and Sales), customers, and partners to create marketing plans to fulfill pipeline and revenue targets. I&#8217;m always working to remove roadblocks with my team so we all thrive while watching how the headlines impact our customers&#8217; daily supply chain challenges. So, while the puzzle constantly changes, I have all the right pieces to solve the challenges that sit in front of me with my Marketing expertise, passion for technology and insights, and people.  </p>\r\n<h4>  2. What has your experience been as a woman working in a male-dominated supply chain technology space?</h4>\r\n<p>  Dynamic—I am actively watching history evolve every day. Being a female leader has opened doors to unique opportunities. I&#8217;ve led many women&#8217;s networking activities, hosted my own LinkedIn Live series for &#8220;Women In Supply Chain™,&#8221; and participated in the SAP Women in Business Network—meeting talented female colleagues from diverse backgrounds. I see women leaders rising to the top. Not only at SAP but also climbing the ranks with many of our customers and partners. Our force is strong. I hope you ask me this same question in the future, and I can answer, &#8220;it isn&#8217;t a male-dominated industry anymore.&#8221; <span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">.</span></p>\r\n<h4>  3. What have been the biggest takeaways from your mentors?</h4>\r\n<p>  I worked as a consultant for a software company early in my career, and in my first week on the job, I was invited to a board meeting with a client to discuss the project. Five middle-aged men were sitting at the table before our consulting team of me and my three male colleagues. When I entered the room, a senior female executive (who would become my mentor) pulled me aside and said, &#8220;Go show these men what you got, Mindy. You are powerful.&#8221; I was irritated that she&#8217;d pull only me aside and not the men with me. I didn&#8217;t understand that we were selling ourselves for the consulting engagement. I took my seat at the table (right next to the COO), and when it came time for me to speak, my mentor&#8217;s few words gave me the extra jolt of confidence to shine in the meeting. She was my first mentor, and the client selected me for the project. I love telling this story. After that first mentor advocated for me, I fully believe in having mentors, coaches, and mentoring others. I often find someone outside my reporting structure in another functional role, regardless of gender. The more perspectives you can garner from others&#8217; experiences, the more you learn and grow in your career.  </p>\r\n<h4>  4. How did you find your voice as an influencer in supply chain marketing and technology?</h4>\r\n<p>  Last year at SAPPHIRE Orlando, I had the opportunity to speak about Digital Supply Chain on live TV in front of hundreds of thousands of viewers. I spoke right before our CEO arrived on stage to welcome the live crowd. I knew the topic, but I still studied, worked with a speaking coach, watched videos, connected with mentors and other successful leaders, and practiced my talking points repeatedly and in front of a mirror. Then, the night before, I relaxed. It&#8217;s funny, I&#8217;ve been writing and speaking throughout my entire career, but for some reason, the live TV aspect made me incredibly nervous. I realized that it’s true—you know more than you think you do. The answers just flowed. I didn&#8217;t want it to end. I was so proud of my big &#8216;moment&#8217; on TV.  And it continues to this day—I was recently featured on the front cover of <u>CIO Look Magazine</u> and have unleashed my voice across mediums through speaking and writing.  </p>\r\n<h4>  5. What advice do you have for other women looking to lead in supply chain technology?</h4>\r\n<p>  Carve your path based on your passion and skills. Demonstrate a strong work ethic by always following through on your commitments.  Take risks—get comfortable with being uncomfortable. There have been multiple times in my career when I was unhappy. Instead of stewing, I created my job description and then manifested my professional goals in my daily activities, reaching out to executives to offer my leadership and skills. Yes, I was anxious about rejection, but I always moved forward. I have created new business charters due to my motivation and clarity on what I have to offer, aligned with my aspirations.  </p>\r\n<h4>  6. What are your big goals for this year?</h4>\r\n<p>  Be present. I&#8217;m working on letting go of the &#8216;small stuff&#8217; and focusing on making a big impact by embracing every moment. Develop solid and meaningful connections. I recently read an article in Harvard Business Review about an 85-year-old study on &#8216;happiness.&#8217; The findings reveal what social creatures we all are and that the path to happiness is fulfillment through our connections with people, not the quantity, but the quality.  Do you have people you can confide in?  Have fun with?  Have common interests?  This includes both personal and professional. And finally, embrace conflict. I am learning how to navigate healthy conflict to help move the needle and make positive change.  </p>\r\n<h4>  7. What have you learned on your supply chain journey so far, and what&#8217;s next?</h4>\r\n<p>  I&#8217;ve learned that no one but me defines me, what I want to do, and whom I want to be. I can carve my path if I demonstrate passion, leadership, and a strong work ethic. The more I learn, the more confidence I gain. In the face of change, staying calm and focused keeps me on pace and ahead. Let go of past mistakes, learn from them, and keep moving forward. Prioritization, time management, and big impact hold much more weight than daily chaos. I&#8217;m embracing a growth mindset.  </p>\r\n<h4>  8. Is there a woman leader who inspires you?</h4>\r\n<p>  Michelle Obama is my role model, both as a professional and as a mother. She is intellectually driven and lives her life guided by her moral compass. Michelle has had many different roles throughout her life, from student, lawyer, daughter, sister, mother, nonprofit leader, author, and of course&#8230; First Lady). She continues to grow as her own person. I, too, have to manage a full-time job, my two kids, my marriage, my friends, and my extended family while maintaining balance and a healthy lifestyle. Ms. Obama seems to do it all with grace and compassion; wow, she has a voice. My motto is &#8220;YOLO&#8221; (You Only Live Once). I always strive to put myself in as many different experiences and roles as possible, so I&#8217;m always evolving. And I try to follow in Ms. Obama’s footsteps, to live, learn, and grow with each moment.  </p>\r\n<h4>  10. What does being recognized in the Women In Supply Chain™ Series mean to you?</h4>\r\n<p>  I am an unwavering advocate for women in the workplace, especially around supply chain topics. So, I was thrilled when <em>Let’s Talk Supply Chain</em> reached out about being featured in Women In Supply Chain™. Having a &#8216;voice&#8217; for women in the marketplace brings fulfillment to my work every day. It inspires me to keep going and to share my knowledge and connections with my network and beyond. I want my daughter to learn how to raise her voice for positive action.  </p>\r\n<h2 id=\"about-the-author\">About the Author</h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:post-content -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"left\",\"id\":7115,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\r\n<figure class=\"alignleft size-full\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-14092\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NSW-300x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NSW-300x300.png 300w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NSW-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NSW-150x150.png 150w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NSW-768x768.png 768w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NSW-600x600.png 600w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NSW-100x100.png 100w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NSW.png 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></figure>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- /wp:image -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Naomi Sylvian (She/Her/Hers) is a Senior Manager, Supply Chain Solutions Marketing at Anaplan where she supports brand awareness and expansion—leading marketers to simplify supply chain planning, make it profitable, and ignite agility by integrating other key business planning areas.

    "content": "<p>As supply chain disruption has maintained a maddening crescendo over the past few years, empowering women in the maritime industry is coming clearly into focus as the need for more strategic leadership grows. From port congestion to worker shortages and labor negotiations to ESG changes, shipping is front-and-center in the ongoing dialogue around logistics. Experts have already <a href=\"https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/freight-container-shipping-trends\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">highlighted shipping and manufacturing delays</a> as a continuing supply chain challenge over the next year. Amid a global pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and port delays, leaders in supply chain are constantly navigating the latest wave of maritime obstacles. Nearly 80% of worldwide ports are experiencing notably longer turnaround times. In the pre-COVID era, late container ships were only delayed a few days. This year, only about <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-17/port-gridlock-stretches-supply-lines-thin-in-blow-for-economies?cmpid=BBD101721_MKT&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_term=211017&amp;utm_campaign=marketsasia&amp;sref=JRhJTHjQ\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">34% of container vessels</a> made it to their destinations on time, with most of them delayed by over a week. McKinsey states, “Clogged ports, expensive cargo capacity, and emergency shipments became prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, the conflict in Ukraine has also contributed to product-line closures, transport delays, and spiraling input costs.” Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90799235/6-trends-global-supply-chain-2023\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">new challenges</a> are on the horizon, with climate change driving additional issues and government intervention in ESG planning after the latest findings that countries everywhere are falling short on emissions goals and need to get more aggressive in the fight against global warming. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/26/current-emissions-pledges-will-lead-to-catastrophic-climate-breakdown-says-un\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the United Nations</a> has urged governments globally to set new goals and make deeper cuts to counter rising temperatures. The maritime industry has never been more primed to grow a more diverse workforce and leaders. Because while women in leadership have made incredible progress over the last decade, there’s still much work to do in bringing woman leaders into male-dominated workforces like the maritime industry. And according to the research, gender diversity is an important investment. <a href=\"https://www.onlinemba.com/blog/why-women-make-better-business-leaders/#:~:text=Women%20also%20pull%20ahead%20in,inclusion%20(DEI)%20as%20well.\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Harvard Business Review</a> found that women in business scored higher than their male counterparts in key leadership areas, including resilience and results-driven attitudes, teamwork, and bold leadership. At Let&#8217;s Talk Supply Chain™, we believe every business can identify more intelligent approaches when more women and diverse voices are in the mix. We&#8217;re committed to closing the supply-chain gender gap by bringing more visibility around women leaders in the logistics community who are making bold moves and breakout career achievements.

Tell us about your journey in supply chain:</h4>\r\n<p>I’ve always been drawn to the water. I grew up sailing in Michigan with my dad on the Great Lakes and followed that passion into my career. I studied International Political Science and International Studies at my alma mater, Hope College, but was still drawn to the water by joining the Hope College sailing team and renting a house right on a channel to Lake Michigan senior year. From there, I found the maritime law program at Roger Williams University School of Law. I went to Rhode Island to pursue the JD/Master of Marine Affairs joint degree, recognizing that maritime was a natural connection point between my love of the water and my educational interests in international affairs. In my career, I have been fortunate to have had opportunities in both federal regulation in Washington, DC, and boots on the dock by working at a port. My ability to connect with my clients and supply chain colleagues comes from that personal experience. I’ve been there, I’ve seen it—I understand what the industry feels like at an operational level. And I can translate the federal side because I’ve been one of the regulators.  </p>\r\n<h4>  2. What has your experience been as a woman working in a male-dominated maritime industry?</h4>\r\n<p>  After law school, I had my first big break in the industry, an offer to work and move to Washington, D.C., at the young age of 27. By 28, I was the international affairs attorney for the Federal Maritime Commission and responsible for the international activities of the Commission via the FMC’s Office of the General Counsel. I was fortunate to work with many women in the office, and my first General Counsel (my direct supervisor) was a woman. However, the industry is slow to change. Supply chain is a male-dominated industry, and the maritime sector of the supply chain is even more so. I like to describe my experience working as a woman in the maritime industry as the exception, (not the rule). In general, I have been fortunate to have a collection of great experiences. However, every once and a while in my career, there has been an instance that would make me think, <em>“huh, we’re still stuck in these old ways?” </em> All women in a historically male-dominated industry will have many stories of their experiences—some comical and some concerning. Enlisting a supportive network of mentors (both men and women) helped me shape a more positive experience. Having a network to strategize your career, solicit feedback in strife, and generally champion your progression is critical. There is plenty of room for all of us, and opportunities are best when widely shared. Additionally, there has been a movement in recent years to shine a light on the <a href=\"https://www.socp.us/sash-prevention\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment (SASH)</a> of women in the maritime industry. This is critically important to ensure that our women mariners are not only safe in their workplace but feel supported to speak up when incidents occur. Going out to sea is a difficult task, but it shouldn’t be made more difficult by predatory behavior.</p>\r\n<h4> </h4>\r\n<h4>  3. What have you learned from your maritime and supply chain mentors?</h4>\r\n<p>I credit my mentors with the successes I have enjoyed. One mentor advised that <em>I seek the opportunity, not just the dream</em>, as I faced decisions. This advice opened up my eyes to opportunities that I may not have even given a second thought to previously, which in turn led to some of my most important career experiences and learning opportunities. Mentors empower a crowd-sourced counsel of trusted and valued advisors and help expand your perception and understanding of decisions before you.  </p>\r\n<h4>  4. How did you find your voice as an authority in maritime law?</h4>\r\n<p>  Experience and mentors. We all know that the more experience you have, the more confidence you gain, but even with that confidence, a trusted advisor is often critical to sound decisions. I teach many graduate-level programs, and one of my teaching ethe is that everyone has something to learn and everyone has something to teach. By using your voice you help those around you to learn. I started my company, The Maritime Professor™, based on this premise. I am a lawyer and have many clients that seek my legal advice, but not all questions are legal. And sometimes a sharing of knowledge for educational purposes can help move the entire industry forward. Let’s keep breaking down the silos of the supply chain by sharing experiences, industry nuances, and terminology. I’ve discovered so many parallels between ocean transport and surface transport. If we don’t start to break down those misunderstandings, we will be stuck in our disconnected default ways.</p>\r\n<h4>  5. What advice do you have for other women looking to lead in maritime?</h4>\r\n<p>  Find mentors at all stages of your career. Commit yourself to learning. Find as many opportunities for exposure and experience in the field as you can. And always remember, the supply chain and maritime industry is incredibly small—be authentic, and that will take you far.</p>\r\n<h4>  6. What have you learned about yourself as a leader on your supply chain journey so far, and what’s next for you?</h4>\r\n<p>  I’ve learned the importance of adaptability to stay current, effective, and relevant. It is so important to stay nimble and maintain a commitment to constant improvement with a growth mindset. The industry moves fast, and so do I. It’s important to stay engaged in the conversation while also preserving historical knowledge and understanding the bigger picture. Moving into the future, in expanding my understanding of all facets of the supply chain, I have committed to taking a deeper dive into the surface transportation side. The more I learn, the more I want to share that knowledge so I can continue to provide helpful translations of the industry—both maritime to surface transport. In addition, I want to share my findings on surface transport on the maritime side. I’d love to be part of breaking those silos down. I am also working to continue as a mentor to students and entry-level career supply chain professionals. I have had many mentors and advisors throughout my career progression, and it’s rewarding to pay it forward.</p>\r\n<h4>  7. What have you learned on your supply chain journey so far, and what&#8217;s next?</h4>\r\n<p>  I&#8217;ve learned to trust myself more and remember that even if sometimes taking risks in my career doesn&#8217;t work out, the attempts themselves are critical opportunities for professional growth.  Stepping outside of your comfort zone and taking a leap can be uncomfortable, and failing isn&#8217;t pretty, but it&#8217;s what you do after the breakdown that matters most. In the future, I want to continue working with leaders at companies that are pushing the boundaries on how technology and/or industry standards can create transparent supply chains.</p>\r\n<h4>  8. Who inspires you?</h4>\r\n<p>  There are so many individuals whom I admire in the maritime industry. Above all, I’m inspired by the merchant mariners (of all genders). Their job is an often-overlooked component of society, but their work keeps 90% of everything consumers use, eat, wear, etc., moving and available. They play a vital role in keeping society running, and few are aware of that. Merchant mariners continue to do important and grueling work without the recognition or the fanfare they deserve.  </p>\r\n<h4>  10. What does being recognized in the Women In Supply Chain™ Series mean to you?</h4>\r\n<p>  I am honored to be featured in the Women In Supply Chain™ series. You have highlighted so many capable and accomplished women. I am fortunate to be among the ranks. It is important to showcase a variety of women across the professional community as there are many components of the supply chain. I&#8217;m proud to represent a maritime perspective and help others expand their career considerations (and general industry knowledge) to include the ocean-shipping side of the industry.  </p>\r\n<h2 id=\"about-the-author\">About the Author</h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:post-content -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"left\",\"id\":7115,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\r\n<figure class=\"alignleft size-full\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-14092\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NSW-300x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NSW-300x300.png 300w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NSW-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NSW-150x150.png 150w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NSW-768x768.png 768w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NSW-600x600.png 600w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NSW-100x100.png 100w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NSW.png 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></figure>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- /wp:image -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Naomi Sylvian (She/Her/Hers) is a Senior Manager, Supply Chain Solutions Marketing at Anaplan where she supports brand awareness and expansion—leading marketers to simplify supply chain planning, make it profitable, and ignite agility by integrating other key business planning areas.

Meredith has a passion for advocating for Women In Supply Chain™.  She majored in Logistics Management from Stellenbosch University while earning a Certificate Programme in Business Analysis from Faculty Training Institute </p>\r\n<h2> </h2>\r\n<h2><strong>What is your name?*</strong></h2>\r\n<p>Audria Allies</p>\r\n<h2><strong>What is your title?*</strong></h2>\r\n<p>Business Process Manager &#8211; Imports</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Please write a few sentences about what being featured in the Women In Supply Chain™ series means to you.*</strong></h2>\r\n<p>With the supply chain industry being largely male-dominated, it is encouraging and refreshing to see women have a platform to grow their voices. Moreover, it&#8217;s an honor to be at the forefront of this movement. Through the Women In Supply Chain™ Series, I hope to share my experience and encourage others.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Tell us about your journey, from where you started to where you are now.*</strong></h2>\r\n<p>My journey in supply chain started quite early, but like most people, it happened by chance. When I started my studies in 2008, my initial major was marketing management, hoping to tackle the advertising industry one day. I took logistics management as a selective subject, and by the end of my second year, I switched to a double major (marketing and logistics management). During my postgraduate studies, I specialized in maritime studies before beginning my career in fashion retail supply chain. As part of a graduate program at one of the major fashion and lifestyle retail brands in South Africa, I started as a supply chain trainee in 2013. My career took a detour in 2014, where I worked as a business process analyst focused on supply chain and internal business process improvement. In 2018, I moved to the shipping department to work as a supply chain and business process analyst, often switching between the two. As of 2021, I am a business process manager leading a team of 10 people with import operations and import costings.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>What has your experience been as a woman, working in a historically male-dominated industry?*</strong></h2>\r\n<p>Being a woman in corporate alone has proven to have its challenges, so having to deal with these challenges within the supply chain industry is not surprising and no different. While I respect my male counterparts, I found myself having to justify my thoughts, opinions, and contribution to my peers. I&#8217;m often viewed as too young to be in the supply chain industry, although having amassed nearly 10 years of experience. In recent years, it&#8217;s been wonderful to see women take up senior roles within the industry, I&#8217;m fortunate to have witnessed and been surrounded by some of these women, and that we finally have a seat at the proverbial table.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Have you had a mentor in your career, how did they help?*</strong></h2>\r\n<p>Having people who are able to guide you professionally and sometimes in a personal capacity is critical. I&#8217;ve been fortunate to have both male and female mentors who have contributed to my success and continue to do so. I grew to trust these people, who knew me, my goals, aspirations, strengths, and weaknesses. As a result, they can represent me and advocate for me even when I&#8217;m not present.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Is there anyone in the industry, or outside of it, who you really admire? Why them?*</strong></h2>\r\n<p>There are a couple of people who have recently inspired me not necessarily within the supply chain industry. A few persons to note is one of my lecturers who is one of the first Women In Supply Chain™ I&#8217;ve met &#8211; Dr. Leila Goedhals-Gerber (Professor at Stellenbosch University). Her work and contribution to Southern African logistics and transport have been awe-inspiring. Most recently, Sarah Barnes-Humphrey has inspired me to get out there and be more active in the supply chain community, her work educating and connecting supply chain enthusiasts and professionals have given me the motivation and have re-ignited a passion that I lost. Last, but not least, I can&#8217;t not mention my current manager, Miriam Patel (Head of Shipping at The Foschini Group Pty Ltd). Thanks to her extensive knowledge and experience within the imports and exports space, as well as her investment in my personal development, I will always be grateful to her.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>How did you find your voice &#8211; was there one moment when everything came together for you?*</strong></h2>\r\n<p>There hasn&#8217;t been one particular moment, but I&#8217;m reminded on a daily basis how I&#8217;m valued for my knowledge and expertise within supply chain. I&#8217;ve recently decided to expand my network and build my brand. One of my aspirations is to advocate for Women In Supply Chain™, therefore being approached for this series is one of the most exciting highlights of my year. I&#8217;ve also recently joined boom! which is a global network, a community that connects, inspire, and celebrates Women In Supply Chain™.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>On your journey so far, what have you learned about yourself, and what does the future hold for you?*</strong></h2>\r\n<p>I&#8217;ve always been one to go with the flow, and I always felt that my career was in the hands of others. As I&#8217;ve grown in my knowledge, enthusiasm, and values, I&#8217;ve discovered that I own my career and that it is up to me to ensure that I advocate for myself. I&#8217;ve also learned that not everyone will like you and that&#8217;s ok &#8211; you can&#8217;t make everyone happy.

Between climate-driven events, COVID closures, and continually growing talent gaps, the human side of supply chain is an important element that needs to come into focus—both the impacts of supply chain disruption on consumers, their communities and families. Whether it’s the quick and powerful response to make new vaccines and medications available to more urban and rural communities, or working to end the <a href=\"https://www.anaplan.com/blog/what-supply-chain-leaders-must-learn-from-the-baby-formula-shortage/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">baby formula shortage</a>—supply chain professionals are working behind the scenes to protect our way of life amidst unprecedented volatility.</p>\r\n<p><br />Even as pandemic requirements and parameters fade into recent memory, supply chain managers still face an <a href=\"https://supplychaincareers.com/supply-chain-talent-shortage/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ongoing labor shortage</a>. The talent gap is one of the significant challenges that propel ongoing delays, limitations, shortages, and stock-outs. Meanwhile, we still aren’t having enough meaningful dialogues around closing the gender gap in supply chain, and how it can help companies gain speed and grow. Because we can’t look at the human side of supply chain without examining how the gender gap is holding back the industry. There’s recent research showing <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/agility-curiosity-top-traits-in-women-cxos/articleshow/91729133.cms\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Women In Supply Chain™ bring more curiosity and agility</a> to their organizations to empower breakthroughs in performance.</p>\r\n<p><br />At Let’s Talk Supply Chain, the human side of Supply Chain drives us. We’re committed to helping to close the supply chain gender gap by elevating the voices of women making leaps and bounds in their careers to support innovative new approaches. Every month our <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/women-in-supply-chain/wisc-blog/\">Women In Supply Chain™ blog series</a> brings you the female trailblazers who are making bold moves and reshaping the industry as we know it. Let’s Talk Supply Chain gives women leaders a platform to share what motivates them and how they are sparking real progress in their organizations.</p>\r\n<p><br />Let&#8217;s Talk Supply Chain™ explores challenges women supply chain leaders navigate every day that all too often go unnoticed. We celebrate their milestone achievements and the starting points that positioned them for their latest wins, ushering change at organizations across the global supply chain. In our Women In Supply Chain™ blog series, you hear from female thought leaders across the global industry about their roots, their stories, the obstacles they’ve faced and overcome, and the career advice they have for others working their way up the chain.</p>\r\n<p><br />This month we’re proud to highlight <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/meredith-singletary-b824512/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Meredith Singletary</a>, Senior HR Director for DHL Supply Chain. Meredith boasts more than two decades of experience in human resources and supply chain. She is certified in PHR with a Graduate Certificate in Training and Performance Improvement from Capella University and a Bachelor’s Degree in Business from Southwestern University.</p>\r\n<h1><br />1. How did you start your journey in supply chain?</h1>\r\n<p><br />I started in Supply Chain as a Human Resources Manager over four sites and a hundred team members. Now, decades later at DHL Supply Chain, I am responsible for 55 sites and overseeing more than 4,000 team members while heading up <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/podcast/diversity-and-inclusion-blended/\">Diversity and Inclusion initiatives</a> for North America. I’m proud that so much of this professional journey has occurred at a workplace focused on diversity, thought leadership, and innovative thinking and a business that is part of the solution, leveling up warehouses to meet modern challenges. I started as an Area HR Manager at DHL before moving on to be an Area HR Director and now a Senior HR Director.</p>\r\n<h1><br />2. Have you had mentors, if not, who do you admire?</h1>\r\n<p><br />I haven’t had a formal mentor, but I’ve been gifted with many, many informal ones. I like to ‘talk through’ a scenario, and it’s always comforting to get another perspective. Whether that’s either figuring out if you are on the right track, or support to help show you that there may be something you are missing.<br /><br />I enjoy listening to the podcast <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/we-can-do-hard-things-with-glennon-doyle/id1564530722\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">We Can Do Hard Things by Glennon Doyle</a>, Abby Wambach, and Amanda Doyle. They do a good job diving into people’s lives and have helped me to learn a different perspective on many different topics in a way that makes me want to learn more. The podcast and women go deep into things that I haven’t thought about before, and I often come out the other side with a little more empathy and understanding for humanity—the human side of things.</p>\r\n<h1>3. Tell us about what it&#8217;s like to be a woman in a male-dominated industry:</h1>\r\n<p><br />When I first started in the industry, I didn’t really understand what it meant to be a Woman in Supply Chain. I was just a woman, going to work every day. But year over year, you learn that there are some experiences that you have as a woman that men just don’t face. I’m proud to help shed light on what that story has looked like for me. <br /><br />When we look at the human side of supply chain, it’s important to share that being a woman in a male-dominated field can be challenging. So, having opportunities to connect with other women in the industry is a breath of fresh air. Hearing that my experiences are often mirrored by others and their experiences reminds me that I am not alone in my journey, whether it is in challenging environments or not. None of us are alone. It’s important to have those discussions and reminders.<br /><br />4. When did you find your voice in supply chain?<br />I found my voice in supply chain the first time I told a group of women what my experiences were in the industry, and they reacted with support and solidarity, I learned that the more vulnerable and authentic you are in leadership, the more people genuinely want to listen.</p>\r\n<h1>6. What’s next on your supply chain journey?</h1>\r\n<p>Getting a chance to influence change in a positive way for DHL Supply Chain is quite possibly the most rewarding work of my career. I can only hope for more opportunities to continue doing that kind of work. It’s been a fantastic journey thus far, and I look forward to lots more adventures ahead.</p>\r\n<h1>7. What advice do you have for women on how we can all close the gender gap in supply chain?</h1>\r\n<p>Be authentic and support underrepresented groups, including other women. It’s important to find and empower a sense of belonging. People do their best work when they feel safe, valued, and accepted.</p>\r\n<h3><br />You can follow Meredith on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/meredith-singletary-b824512/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn</a> for more insights.</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This Women In Supply Chain™ feature was sponsored by Sifted.

Melissa has a Project Manager Professional (IT) Master’s Certificate from The George Washington University and a Masters in Management Information Systems from Auburn University. This summer her book <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Transforming the Organization: Building a Flexible Foundation for Future Disruption</span> makes its debut.</p>\r\n<h1>1. How did your supply chain journey start?</h1>\r\n<p>I started my journey in 1995, paying my way through college with a company I created. The premise was working with local companies across Alabama, Georgia, and Northern Florida developing tools to provide more visibility into their suppliers across their supply chain.</p>\r\n<p>Since then, I have developed AI models for a spend visibility application (2004 – 2006). I’ve consulted with several global cloud (currently ranked in the top 6) procurement &amp; supply chain application providers (2008-2012) influencing their future product roadmaps. I continue to mentor other individuals and diverse-owned companies (2006 – present). As a consultant, I have the rare privilege to collaborate with fortune 100 companies where I am making a difference.</p>\r\n<p>Each step in my journey has expanded my knowledge, folding in expertise across the entire supplier lifecycle (procurement, diversity, risk, etc.) while addressing ancillary processes (tax, legal, change management, etc.) to expanding how AI is impacting us both professionally and personally as suppliers &amp; consumers.</p>\r\n<h1>2. How have mentors supported your career growth in the supply chain?</h1>\r\n<p>I have had a few mentors in my career. I worked with my first mentor at Kearney (1998-2001). I was frustrated and walked into his office to vent elaborately about a project. He listened and when I stopped, he asked a simple question, ‘when was the last time you had a day off?’. Wow, that took me completely by surprise. When I could not answer the question, he offered me the opportunity to take off one Friday each month for the remainder of the project.</p>\r\n<p>I was lucky to learn very early in my career I needed downtime not just for me personally or to accommodate a work-life balance (which didn’t exist back then), but to have time to think and reflect. Even now, I block out time on Fridays to think about the week, the people I’ve met, and the challenges I need to solve and come up with creative solutions.</p>\r\n<p>Later in my career (2006-2007) my boss became my mentor. At that time, I was thinking about my personal advisory board of folks who I knew I could connect with throughout my career and who had expertise in areas where I had gaps. Even today, I still talk with her about job changes, career strategy, navigating c-suite level politics, etc. The conversations change over time because I’m always at different career stages when we find time to reconnect.</p>\r\n<p>Fast forward to today, I have added a couple more to the team. Each one with a different perspective, background, or age to help me see things I sometimes can’t.</p>\r\n<h1>3. Tell us about what it&#8217;s like to be a woman in a male-dominated industry:</h1>\r\n<p>When I first started my professional career, I was always the first woman in the department or on a project. Whether it was developing procurement and supply chain applications, data management, process, strategy, or talking to a client, I was the only woman present. As a result, I had to find creative ways to have a voice in the conversation. I learned to talk fast, to be very concise, and jump in when anyone paused for more than a few seconds.</p>\r\n<p>Today, I still talk probably too fast, but I am surprised at how much we haven’t progressed. Recently, within the past few years, I was assigned to an internal female coach/mentor solely because she was also a woman. That was the only criteria they used. It was never considered that I should be paired with someone who can help set me up for success. Even just last year, on conference calls, I still see and hear male executives interrupting women during a presentation to recap what the female presenter had just communicated.</p>\r\n<p>However, I see the other side of closing the gender gap in supply chain as well. We have adopted a paradigm where people hire and work with others who are more like them. Over time, this has evolved into organizations with unbalanced perspectives where managers believe having an opinion or an alternative thought process are signs of confrontation.</p>\r\n<p>Conference executives are looking for more female speakers, but that also means more woman leaders need to raise their hand for speaking opportunities. Not everyone is comfortable with that. For example, a Supply Chain executive confided she didn’t think she had anything worth saying.</p>\r\n<p>This is just one of the reasons why I host a podcast with a focus on global women in procurement and supply chain. Just think about the ripple effect we can have—together. If each of us can assist one woman in being successful, who then assists another woman, our small ripple will have a much broader impact large enough to make waves.</p>\r\n<p>Forget the gender gap in supply chain, let’s create a gender WAVE!</p>\r\n<h1>4. When did you find your voice in supply chain?</h1>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I had to find my voice very quickly in my career to avoid being mistaken for the “coffee girl”. You might laugh, but that was a thing in the late 1990’s and through the early 2000s. More importantly, I had to be the one to make the effort if I wanted my voice to be heard.</p>\r\n<p>There wasn’t one moment when everything came together for me. There have been many moments that mattered. For example, by the time I was 32, I had my dream job at Kearney, traveled the world, and lived in Australia for a year. When I was laid off after 9-11, I felt so lost. What do you do when you’ve already achieved your dream?</p>\r\n<p>I realized I had to come up with another dream, climb another mountain, and develop another skill. Again, I believe I was lucky to experience this early in life—it’s the pattern I’ve adopted ever since. Every new skill supports the others and continuously adds more value for me.</p>\r\n<h1>6. What’s next on your supply chain journey?</h1>\r\n<p>I have a long way to go, but the journey so far has shown me that I’m bold and assertive. I have learned to embrace self-awareness which is why I’m comfortable being uncomfortable. I am willing to make a decision with 80% of the data, and even more O.K. if I make a mistake.</p>\r\n<p>I know I will be accountable and look to resolve it. I can be fiercely loyal, will have your back, and will set aside whatever time I have (after chasing my twin girls), to make time for you. I am brilliant, creative, love learning new things, and still get excited when speaking in small or large forums.The future for me is continuing to have the capacity to mentor others who will surpass me in half the time it took me to climb the ranks in supply chain. I am writing a book and have plans for many, many more. I look forward to future opportunities where I can lend my perspectives and make a visible difference.</p>\r\n<h1>7. What advice do you have for women on how we can all close the gender gap in supply chain?</h1>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Get comfortable with being uncomfortable. You are working with technologies today that didn’t exist just a decade ago. You will work with technologies in 5 years that haven’t been invented yet.</li>\r\n<li>Keep asking questions—that’s what keeps you moving forward.</li>\r\n<li>Start thinking about your personal advisory team now, who can help you bolster some of your own knowledge gaps? Who can give you deeper insights or spicy pep-talks when you need them most?</li>\r\n<li>Set aside time for yourself—thoughts and coffee—and for virtual or in-person networking.</li>\r\n<li>Remember, self-awareness is the key to your growth. As long as you know how to be honest with yourself, you can keep building your skillsets.</li>\r\n<li>Take the time to learn what ‘showing up as your authentic self’ means and looks like for you.</li>\r\n<li>Oh and start an IRA or 401K sooner than later!</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h1>8. What are three milestones you’re working towards this year?</h1>\r\n<p>In 2022, the three (3) milestones I am looking forward to are:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>My modern-day female cancer warrior journey is not quite complete. I have a few more obstacles to overcome but looking to finish in early October 2022.</li>\r\n<li>My first book will finally publish (they say the first book is the hardest)!</li>\r\n<li>For those I am mentoring today, I look forward to seeing them continue the ripple effect by setting someone else up for success.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h3><br />You can follow Melissa Drew on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/m-drew/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/melissadrew0\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> for more insights.</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This Women In Supply Chain™ feature was sponsored by Sifted.

Stephanie is known for her commitment to increasing procurement and supply chain efficiency while empowering visibility through collaboration with internal stakeholders at all levels. Stephanie is dedicated to growing the number of women in procurement and supply chain via networking and social media. Stephanie has a bachelor’s in marketing and management from Lipscomb University and is gaining her license as a Certified Supply Chain Professional by the Institute of Supply Chain Management.</span></p>\r\n<h4><strong><span style=\"font-size: 27.2px;\">1. How did your supply chain journey start?</span></strong></h4>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started out as a Customer Service Manager and Global Purchasing Manager. I worked for both Shippers Paper Products and ITW Cargosafe while managing customer service and handling all the procurement and sourcing functions. I oversaw the warehouse inventory, launched a new MRP systems, and sourced products internationally. I handled all development of domestic and international logistics, and have been in strategic leadership roles for purchasing and supply chain since. I’m currently the Director of Strategic Sourcing for Light and Wonder, content and product creator for land-based casino gaming, social, and digital organizations across the globe.</span></p>\r\n<h4><strong><span style=\"font-size: 27.2px;\">2. How have mentors supported your career growth in the supply chain?</span></strong></h4>\r\n<p>I never knew the value of having a mentor until a couple years ago. We are trained to think we can do it all on our own; especially women. We have to prove ourselves to the world, right? Without a mentor, it is definitely harder to accomplish professional and personal goals. I am lucky to have found a few I consider friends and my growth has skyrocketed since listening and gaining insight from these mentors. I too mentor younger women coming up into the Supply Chain field and love it! There is nothing better than feeling we have made a difference in someone’s life!</p>\r\n<h4><strong>3. Tell us about what it&#8217;s like to be a woman in a male-dominated industry:</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Working in the South in supply chain, you are working in a mainly male oriented industry. This can be a challenge at times as we do not always think alike and have ways of handling opportunities and challenges differently. We have to learn to work better with each other. I would love to see a class at our workplaces that deals with the opposite sex and the way we professional think and work. Sort of like a Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus but for the work area. If we understand what makes each other motivated to do certain things, I think together we could rule the world! I’m on a personal mission to help encourage more women to join the ranks in supply chain and procurement.</p>\r\n<h4><strong><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">4. When did you find your voice in supply chain?</span></strong></h4>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Honestly, I’m just now finding my voice, and it’s a great feeling. For me it has come with age and reaching out to others. I love to learn and have listened well—I never stop listening. I am a typical people pleaser, I’ve learned to assert myself and set boundaries—areas I struggled with earlier in my career. </span></p>\r\n<h4><strong><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">5. Is there anyone you admire professionally who influenced your work?</span></strong></h4>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are so many, </span><a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/sarah-scudder-has-a-message-for-marketing-and-procurement-teams-oh-and-bradley-cooper/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sarah Scudder</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> immediately comes to mind. Sarah is authentic, serves others, is disciplined and follows her own path. Her confidence and positivity are contagious.</span></p>\r\n<h4><strong>6. What does it mean to you to be featured in Women In Supply Chain™?</strong></h4>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Sarah asked me to be part of her Women In Supply Chain™ blog, I felt like I’d won the lottery. (Which is illegal since I’m in the gaming industry, ha!) </span></p>\r\n<h4><strong>7. What advice do you have for women looking to start in the supply chain industry?</strong></h4>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find a mentor, man or woman, but I suggest women whever possible. Always bring your authentic self into networking. Attend industry events, and don’t be afraid to say no.</span></p>\r\n<h4><strong>8. What&#8217;s next on your supply chain journey?</strong></h4>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So many opportunities await! Getting past the fear of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just doing it! </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finding a work-life balance.  I’d love to teach women in college on the reality of the workplace. And one day consult or own a business.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\r\n<p><em>This Women In Supply Chain™ feature was made possible by our sponsor, Emerge.

Hannah is known for her proven ability to lead while contributing to high-level management strategies and overseeing day-to-day operations. She is the former co-founder and Chief Operating Officer of Pie for Providers, an award-winning social enterprise. Hannah has a Bachelor of Arts in Women&#8217;s Studies with a minor in Social Work from Arizona State University, a Master&#8217;s degree in Public Policy and Administration from Northwestern University, and a Master of Business Administration, Entrepreneurship, Operations, and Economics from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. She has also earned her Product Management Certification through General Assembly.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 27.2px;\">1. How did your supply chain journey start?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My journey in Supply Chain started when I relocated from Chicago back to Phoenix. I was looking for work and knew I wanted a change when I found Honeywell. This role was my first introduction to supply chain outside of business school. I thoroughly enjoyed the operations and supply chain-focused courses I took but hadn&#8217;t considered it a career path until that point. At Honeywell, I was fortunate to have a supervisor who went out of his way to show me the ropes of the industry, taking me onsite to suppliers and allowing me to sit in on negotiations. I eventually realized that I missed the start-up environment (I was previously the co-founder of a social enterprise) and found my way to Emerge. Emerge appealed to me because it was the intersection between my old life—bringing technology to an analog industry (child care government programs) and my new life in the aerospace supply chain.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 27.2px;\">2. How have mentors supported your career growth in the supply chain?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My manager, Maggie Petrovic, has been instrumental in my growth as a logistics and supply chain professional. She took a risk when she hired me with no logistics experience and gave me a lot of room and trust to figure things out. Maggie also made space for me to ask all the questions I needed.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>3. Tell us about what it&#8217;s like to be a woman in a male-dominated industry:</strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s been interesting. The start-up that I co-founded was tiny, and except for one intern, all of our employees were women, so it was quite a culture shock going from that to supply chain. My Bachelor&#8217;s is in Women&#8217;s and Gender Studies, so I had at least a theoretical understanding of how gender impacts my experience in the world. Actually working in a male-dominated industry provides a different perspective.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I think it&#8217;s important to note that, as a white woman, when I find other women in this industry, they are more likely to look like me—particularly in leadership positions. As an industry, we have some work to do in supply chain to bring in new and diverse voices and support and promote those voices into leadership roles.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">4. When did you find your voice in supply chain?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last June, I had to present to our leadership team, and I felt like I had to punch above my weight—assessing potential strategies and making my recommendations for both the short and long term. I was nervous that I didn&#8217;t have the experience or clout at the time for my presentation to land the way it should. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My presentation ended up being very well received and laid the groundwork for the expansion of our team and strategies that are still in place today. That presentation and its response marked a turning point for my confidence, both at the company and in the industry. I knew I had gained enough mastery of the sector to do my job well and that I had established myself in the company as a leader.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">5. Is there anyone you admire professionally who influenced your work?</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I still look up to my former co-founder, Chelsea Sprayregen. Chelsea&#8217;s tenacity, candor, and unbelievable amount of grit inspire me. We don&#8217;t connect as often as we did in the past when I was at Pie for Providers. Still, it&#8217;s inspiring to watch her driving forward with her vision for the organization, even from a distance. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The more I reflect on the question, the more I find I&#8217;m just coming up with a list of women I appreciate. I&#8217;ve been fortunate to have met so many women who have supported me, taken chances on me, and helped me in my growth as an individual and a professional. It&#8217;s been wonderful to get to know them and watch them thrive in their paths, and in that way, I think I admire all of them for their strength and individuality.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>6. What does it mean to you to be featured in Women In Supply Chain™?</strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s great to share my experiences with other women and be recognized as a leader in this community. When I joined Emerge, I did a lot of supply chain and logistics research. Through this ongoing research and self-education, I hope that I can contribute to someone else&#8217;s journey in this industry.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>7. What advice do you have for women looking to start in the supply chain industry?</strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;ve learned that it&#8217;s okay not to be the best at things the first (or even the fifth) time you do them. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m alone in having this feeling that I need to succeed on the first try, and I constantly remember that some of our best moments of growth happen when we make mistakes and learn the hard lessons.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><strong>8. What&#8217;s next on your supply chain journey?</strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m not sure what the future holds, there is still a lot for me to do and learn at Emerge, and I&#8217;m excited to see where that takes me.</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\r\n<p><em>This Women In Supply Chain™ feature was made possible by our sponsor, Emerge.

The women and men on the “front-line” — drivers, warehouse associates, logistics planners truly are unsung heroes.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Women In Supply Chain™ roles</strong></p>\r\n<p>In the early 1990s, when I began my career, women working in supply chain were fewer than today. My approach has always been to be the best you can — regardless of gender — and pay it forward by spending time with anyone new to the industry.</p>\r\n<p>That’s why I would like to share some of the “rules of the road” that I have learned in my 30 plus years as a woman working in the supply chain industry.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Go where the action is</strong></p>\r\n<p>To promote a company or its products, you must have a first-hand understanding of how and why they work. And the best way to learn is to leave your desk behind and go where the action is. The first week I worked in transportation, I spent a day riding with a truck driver, worked on a loading dock and assisted with billing.</p>\r\n<p>Later, as I began promoting supply chain technology, I made it a point to learn as much as possible about how to use the technology. I also value the time I have spent with customers – not in corporate meeting rooms, but in their operations. What better way to learn about pain points, practical applications of digital solutions, and best practices?</p>\r\n<p>Today, the technology in supply chain is evolving so rapidly.  As more investment enters the space, all of our tricks of the trade are taking that leap into the 21st century. This is what&#8217;s so exciting about digital solutions like my current company, Emerge.  By reinventing freight procurement in truckload, Emerge is bringing tech-enabled connectivity to a space predominantly controlled by manual spreadsheets and emails.  This is exciting, new and drives innovation in our industry</p>\r\n<p><strong>Make connections and cast your net wide</strong></p>\r\n<p>I have been fortunate to have had several mentors during my career and their leadership has set an example I work to follow. You can also make connections with peers by participating in associations like the former Sales and Marketing Council operated by the American Trucking Association.</p>\r\n<p>Since my career has been focused on public relations, I have also developed relationships with industry journalists. Their views, as neutral parties, have helped me maintain an outside-in perspective and stay abreast of upcoming trends. However, some of the connections I value most are the ones I have developed with truck drivers, warehouse associates, and others who are on the front line every day. Getting to tell their stories is one of the most rewarding parts of any job I have had in the industry.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Communicate, communicate, communicate</strong></p>\r\n<p>In virtually any job, success is often determined by the ability to communicate with others. In this aspect of my career, I have often relied on the skills I was taught in journalism school. Get the facts, prioritize the most critical information first, and focus on telling the story succinctly and in a way that anyone can understand. And most importantly, learn how to listen. It is amazing how your perspectives may change when you engage in active listening, with people across your organization and industry.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Be an agent for positive change</strong></p>\r\n<p>I have always been a “glass half full” person. Don’t get distracted by negativity and focusing on aspects of a situation that you cannot directly impact. Instead, look for ways to drive positive change in all the avenues available to you &#8211; education, mentoring those just entering the industry and by being active in programs to support diversity and inclusion.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\r\n<p><em>This Women In Supply Chain™ feature was made possible by our sponsor, Emerge.

Known for empowering endless business process innovation in the Asia Pacific, China, and Japan, Lee is a recognized supply chain thought leader at Dell Malaysia. Lee is currently the Senior Director, Global Demand Supply Planning, overseeing planning, operations, and end-to-end services. She has a Fellow Diploma from the UK Society of Business Practitioners in Leadership and Strategy, a master&#8217;s degree from the National University of Singapore, and a bachelor&#8217;s degree from Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-how-did-your-supply-chain-journey-start\">1. How did your supply chain journey start?</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I launched my career in Regional Product Marketing (APJ). From my client interactions, I learned they struggled with long lead times and inconsistent supply—I was determined to find solutions. After two years of intensive travel with the urge for greater stability, I moved into Production Planning. Still young, fearless, and seemingly invincible, I knew I could make a difference in reducing lead times and improving supply by acting as the voice of production clients.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I approached my manager, asking for a transfer to Production Planning. I learned on-the-job that Production Planning supported but could not significantly reduce lead times, so I asked for a transfer to Material Management to make a more significant impact. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>That is my modus operandi as I move along the supply chain—learning new areas and moving on to find more meaningful solutions—always looking forward to the new challenges ahead to help resolve the very real and abundant supply issues impacting clients every day.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Every two to three years, I extended my job scope to cover more, first Material Management, then Finished Goods (FG) Logistics Warehouse Operations and Freight, and onto Sales &amp; Operating Planning, Customer Care, and finally, Order Processing. Over my supply chain career, I have worked across Manufacturing and Regional Sales organizations to land at Dell, a technology giant renowned for its supply chain leadership. So, when the opportunity came, I embraced it and never looked back. Thrilled and ready to venture into the Dell Services Parts organization—a brand new field for me.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I have spent more than half of my supply chain career here at Dell. Over the past 15 years here, I&#8217;ve managed APJ Services, Logistics, Reverse Logistics, Repair Operations, and Services Parts Planning. In November, I started my latest role in supply chain leadership at Dell as the Global Demand-Supply Planning Director for Client Services.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-how-have-mentors-supported-your-career-growth-in-the-supply-chain\">2. How have mentors supported your career growth in the supply chain?</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I have been privileged to have a few mentors throughout the different stages of my career in supply chain—suited to unique areas, and situations as my own supply chain journey has rapidly evolved and advanced into the new areas. As I broke into a new field or section across the supply chain every few years, my mentors helped me to get started in assessing and learning the new areas so I could innovate in each space. Every mentor had tips on how to grow my career while identifying solutions to resolve business issues across the chain. Every mentor has made an impact on my development in supply chain.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-how-have-mentors-supported-your-career-growth-in-the-supply-chain\">3. When you think back on the mentors you&#8217;ve had in supply chain, is there one you admire whose teaching has stuck with you the most?</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Simon WK Wong, the now-retired but then Vice President of Asia Operations at Dell. Simon and a few other supply chain leaders from other multi-national corporations, including Motorola, Intel, and AMD, set up a recurring monthly supply chain forum in Penang, Malaysia, for supply chain practitioners. As a young supply chain professional, I learned a tremendous amount from these leaders across different forums, and Simon stood out.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Simon was humble even while showing his apparent command of complex supply chain initiatives at Dell and sharing industry best practices and robust solutions. He was instrumental in building the Dell Factory in Penang and repeating the same growth and results in Xiamen, China. Simon successfully launched the U.S. Direct Ship initiative from Penang—shipping up to 1M units daily.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Back then, Simon didn&#8217;t have a big name in the industry. He was an unknown. He would answer our questions and patiently break down and explain some of the most complicated supply obstacles and approaches.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When I first joined Dell, Simon was the Managing Director for Dell Malaysia. He drove the Talent Development Program for a more robust and diverse senior leadership team. He always had time for one-on-one meetings and was ready to share his ideas and insights. Simon was a powerful force in helping me maneuver my supply chain career progression at Dell when I was at a professional crossroads—he is a talented supply chain thought leader and a man of great integrity.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4-what-unique-obstacles-have-you-faced-as-a-woman-in-supply-chain\">4.  What unique obstacles have you faced as a woman in supply chain?</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I&#8217;ve faced the most challenging moments in my career in Logistics and Production. In both areas, you need to keep your calm and stand firm in negotiation to push for action and drive real results. Even as Women In Supply Chain™, we don&#8217;t always need to be loud and aggressive to be heard in a male-dominated industry. I constantly harness relevant data and information in communication with clear deliverables to build transparency and trust in my approach. Going onsite to the grounds for an all-hands-on-deck approach in person has been hugely instrumental as well. I love walking around the warehouse and production floors and getting one-on-one feedback from the operators. As Sarah Barnes says, <em>collaboration </em>really is the future of supply chain.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5-what-have-you-learned-about-yourself-so-far-on-your-supply-chain-journey\">5. What have you learned about yourself so far on your supply chain journey?</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I&#8217;ve learned that I can thrive in supply chain leadership roles because I embrace change and uncertainty—I enjoy fresh challenges. Finding new solutions is rewarding. I am able to see that process improvement in customer satisfaction scores and company performance and financials, and that&#8217;s incredibly rewarding. With my education and foundation in research, I&#8217;m analytical and ready, and able to connect the dots with coherence and agility. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"6-how-have-you-found-your-voice-as-a-leader-in-supply-chain\">6. How have you found your voice as a leader in supply chain?</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>After six years taking on various supply chain roles in manufacturing, I was hired by a new Regional Sales organization to improve Order Processing, Logistics, and Inventory Management. The business had just implemented its new CRM order processing inventory management system and the team was facing a myriad of issues. In most of my one-on-ones with new team members, they opened up that they were ready to leave the organization. I was brand new to managing a regional sales organization supply chain from order intake to inventory planning ad delivering closing sales orders.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>But in three months, as a team, we were able to turn the situation around, recovering lost sales invoicing, enabling invoicing in multiple currencies, and reducing the order and supply lead times. I found my voice by listening, and <em>we </em>made an impact on the organization and our clients. <em>We</em> because it was a collaborative team effort.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In those first few months, I learned that my manufacturing skillset could make a difference across the sales supply chain. However, the most critical piece of the puzzle? The people, my team, who brought and held everything together. Everything I read and absorbed from the Eliyahu M. Goldratt book, The Goal, recommended by mentor Simon Wong stuck with me those first three months, and I applied it every day in my work and team interactions. Knowledge and experience are instrumental in any role in supply chain, but it&#8217;s the ability to empower and unify your team that matters most. Without that alignment across your team, you can&#8217;t accelerate meaningful results across your supply chain. Your supply chain is only as agile as every one of your team members.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"7-what-does-it-mean-to-you-to-be-featured-in-women-in-supply-chain\">7. What does it mean to you to be featured in Women In Supply Chain™?</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The supply chain industry was overwhelmingly male-dominated when I started my career two decades ago. Most of the back-end office work was handled by women in areas like material management. Women have the skills to be successful in supply chain and drive meaningful results with an openness to new ideas and collaborative planning. I hope that my experience and feature in Women In Supply Chain™ will encourage more young women to take the leap and help us build a more innovative and inclusive industry landscape.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"8-what-advice-do-you-have-for-women-looking-to-make-a-start-in-the-supply-chain-industry\">8. What advice do you have for women looking to make a start in the supply chain industry?</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Just go for it. Don&#8217;t let your inhibitions hold you back just because you&#8217;re a woman in a male-dominated industry. You are more than a skirt. Volunteer for the projects you feel strongly about and take risks. I volunteered to move to Production Planning because I was determined to reduce supply lead times.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When you have a higher purpose, or a professional mission, that comes across in your actions and results. Having that purpose as a driver is instrumental in standing out in roles and leadership in supply chain. Don&#8217;t worry about failure, be more concerned about letting your fears hold you back. The minute you take a step forward, you&#8217;re already winning. Even as you learn, you can only move forward.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"9-what-s-next-for-you-in-your-supply-chain-journey\">9. What&#8217;s next for you in your supply chain journey?</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In the next two years, I aim to build a capable, global, and world-class demand-supply planning team here at Dell. I&#8217;d also like to support young up-and-coming supply chain practitioners as Simon Wong did for me when I was starting. I am ready to pay it forward.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\r\n<p><em>This Women In Supply Chain™ feature was made possible by our sponsor, Emerge.

I think that was a real catharsis for me, when I really began trusting that I had the knowledge, experience, and passion to solve any challenge.</span></p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Speaking of challenges, have you faced any in a male-dominated industry?</span></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You know, not until the past few years have I contemplated what it means to be a woman in this industry and what an accomplishment that truly is. I guess I’ve always had the mindset that my performance would speak for itself, and my gender wasn&#8217;t what would define my success.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, it became more and more apparent to me as I moved up to executive levels at companies, that the number of women present in my meetings, my negotiations, my strategy sessions—all were dwindling. It made me step back and realize though yes, I want everyone to be judged solely on their merits. It was still obvious that I needed to be an </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">advocate for those women by mentoring, supporting, and encouraging them to blaze their own path in this field.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am also really happy to say that I&#8217;ve been fortunate to have men throughout my career who saw my potential and were extremely supportive of my growth and development. Men who saw the importance of my presence and the value of a diverse group of talent.</span></p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How critical is it to bring more diversity to the chain?</span></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving forward, it&#8217;s going to be so important that we are actively looking at professionals in the supply chain field for their performance and potential. We need to keep consciously looking for ways to contribute to diversifying this field even further through mentorship, recruiting, and featuring stories about these talented groups of individuals—just like Women In Supply Chain™ does. Visibility and representation matter.</span></p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Tell us more about the support you’ve had along your supply chain journey. Did you have any mentors?</span></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, and they’ve definitely varied based on the season of my career. Each mentor played an important role for the stage I was developing at and I&#8217;m so grateful that in their busy lives—both personally and professionally—they saw the potential in me and took time to nurture it. They went above and beyond providing guidance on how to approach my career. They set such fantastic examples for what I wanted to be known for as a leader. Now I have the privilege of mentoring others. I am often reminded of my mentors, and pass down the guidance and advice they bestowed to me.</span></p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Who has inspired you in supply chain?</span></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For me, it&#8217;s not really about who I admire, but what I admire. I deeply admire and respect the women who are doing it all. Juggling family, personal commitments, and their careers, all while getting that workout in early, looking flawlessly put-together, and ready and able to tell you about their take on current events. And these aren&#8217;t women trying to give you the perception that they have it all figured out. They&#8217;re women who are putting the effort </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in and getting it done. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How can you not admire that?</span></i></p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What have you learned about yourself as a leader on your supply chain journey?</span></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the area I love to talk about. I will always be a strong believer in reflection and lessons learned. I learned that no one will own your career like you will. Yes, go out there and connect, develop mentorship relationships, etc. But remember, you&#8217;re going to need to be your strongest advocate. Your future is too precious and important to leave in anyone&#8217;s hands but your own.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;ve learned that title and upward mobility does not define our success in this industry. I’ve also learned that you will never get ahead if you don&#8217;t put in the work at the level your at right now. It&#8217;s important to be looking forward to where you want to go in your career, but when the opportunity presents itself, you want to be able to show that you are ready </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">for the next level. Nothing says that better than being a rockstar in your current role.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most recently, I&#8217;ve learned you are an example to your people, and your actions and your words have more impact than you think. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a self- professed workaholic, I used to tell myself that I could have a different standard for myself than for my team. But as I worked 10-hour days, I saw my best people start to follow in my footsteps. And when I was sending emails on Sundays, the responses from my team members started to show up within minutes, when before I wouldn&#8217;t receive them until Monday. And you can tell them &#8216;do as I say, not as I do&#8217; as much as you want. At the end of the day, if they see you as successful, they will follow your example. So I&#8217;ve made </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a deliberate effort to pull back from that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not for me, but for them. I&#8217;m hoping this next phase of my career is focused on things like this—being hyper aware and making a strong effort at my level to make a positive impact in my colleagues lives.</span></p>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What advice do you have for women looking to break into or move up in supply chain?</span></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be bold and tenacious. This career field is not for the faint of heart. In Supply Chain, you aren&#8217;t the center of attention. You&#8217;re in it because you have a sense of commitment to seeing your company and the people you work for and with succeed, and you inherently know just how important and vital your role is to an organization. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of us women know we are problem solvers and multitaskers to the core. It’s going to take women like us to continue to carve our place in this industry, to not only hold our representation, but to grow it. And as a woman, know if you come into supply chain as a field, someday you too are going to be called upon to mentor others. I consider it a privilege and I&#8217;m so glad I made the choice to be part of the growing changes in the Supply Chain world.</span></p>\n<ol start=\"9\">\n<li>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What does it mean to you to be featured in Women In Supply Chain™?</span></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learning that I was going to be featured in the Women In Supply Chain™ series was an incredible feeling. It is so rewarding to see that women are being recognized for their very important seat at the table.

Running into product shortages, backorders, and delays is the new normal. Between a historical labor gap, unprecedented demand, and a continuing pandemic, woman supply chain trailblazers continue emerging—bringing fresh momentum and best practices into the mix with them. These female supply chain leaders are fueling innovation to drive a brighter path forward. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Let’s Talk Supply Chain, we understand the value of women tapping into our collective power as professionals in a male-dominated industry—together. Because when Women In Supply Chain™ advocate for each other, big things happen—breaking status quos and glass ceilings to help advance the entire community. At Let&#8217;s Talk Supply Chain™ we&#8217;re dedicated to continually doing our part each month. We’re committed to featuring the achievements of trailblazing women creating a stronger more vibrant supply chain and professional community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In our Women In Supply Chain™ series, Let’s Talk Supply Chain introduces the woman leaders who are dominating the chain now, and unleashing better, smarter outcomes. We ask what and who motivates them and how each is doing her part to create positive change in their organizations, industry, and community. Let&#8217;s Talk Supply Chain™ covers the hurtles these woman leaders have conquered, big leaps of faith, and the beginnings that ultimately led them where they are today, leading businesses across the global supply chain. Read on for career advice, inspiring achievements, and expert guidance on breaking through to the top of the chain.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For our final Women In Supply Chain™ blog of 2021, we&#8217;re proud to feature </span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/elisa-gustavo-ant%C3%B3nio/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elisa Gustavo</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, procurement leader and petroleum engineer with a proven history in the oil and gas sector and fuel trading. Gustavo is the Head of Engineering at Belutécnica with a degree in engineering and petroleum resource management. </span></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> How did your professional journey lead you to a career in supply chain?</span></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have a degree in Petroleum Engineering and Management. I had my first brush with supply chain while taking an academic course covering Petroleum Logistics. We mostly discussed Procurement and Supply Chain. I had no doubts that I wanted to specialize and work in that area. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later, I broke into Logistics and Operations as an intern at a Petroleum trading company in Mozambique. In 2019 I started my career as a Procurement assistant. Due to some implementations and improvement proposals, I was recruited into the procurement department that I now head up today.</span></p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> What has leading in a male-dominated industry taught you as a procurement leader in supply chain?</span></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Working as a woman leader in supply chain has been challenging and inspiring at the same time. It’s challenging being a woman and still being viewed as too young to be in a senior management position in a male-dominated industry. Channeling positive results and motivating other women around me to always seek the best in themselves is inspiring. Because we were all born to shine, God made us to be excellent in everything we do.</span></p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Have you had any mentors on your career path so far?</span></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I consider them more advocates and members of my professional family than mentors. The first is Professor Dr. Rui da Maia, who taught Oil and Gas Logistics, sparking my interest in the area. He passed on a lot of knowledge from working in the petroleum logistics field and has helped me a lot throughout my career. With Dr. Rui da Maia, I learned that information is power and that an informed woman is worth a thousand. This empowered me to continue to search for information. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second is the engineer Quincardete Lourença, CEO of the company where I started as an intern. I consider him responsible for a good part of the professional I am today. I learned from him that I am a super star and that I must never turn off the light of the star that is in me. That is to always give my best and seek solutions for all types of problems. Take responsibility, be disciplined, deliberate, and consistent. I am very grateful to both supply chain leaders.</span></p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Which woman in supply chain inspires you and why?</span></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I admire Marlene de Sousa, a young Mozambique who fights for the development of Human Resources in Mozambique. I respect her a lot because she has brought many innovative ideas that have created a huge impact for HR Management professionals, not only at the national level, but at a global, international scale. Marlene sets the example as a highly professional woman who battles fearlessly daily for the development of HR Management in Mozambique and now in Africa.</span></p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> How have you found your voice as a leader in supply chain?</span></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I lost my fear when I started taking credit and responsibility for my actions as a professional. Fear made me submit to various decisions even though I didn&#8217;t agree. That anxiety prevented me from giving an honest opinion, making decisions, and taking on responsibilities. When detached from that fear I realized the importance and value that my opinions have.</span></p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> What do you want to tell women looking to dive into supply chain and those already in the industry?</span></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a market with so many qualified professionals, having the right attitude makes all the difference. Be bold. Have clear life goals with metrics and deadlines. I have clear goals and I fight to meet them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be a person of words and actions. We were born to be excellent, God made us perfect creatures, do everything with excellence in mind. Be excellent and kind to others. Be humble. Bond with people—we need each other to go far—never stop networking</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What have you learned on your supply chain journey so far?</span></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve learned a lot about myself, and that I am a high-value being. I can inspire and motivate other valued beings. And the best results are realized and achieved through the people around us who are motivated. I always say the future is female. I am that woman who will transform to make an impact, positively shape the Mozambique supply chain, opportunities for the women here, and abroad.</span></p>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What does it mean to you to be featured in our Women In Supply Chain™ Series?</span></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being featured in Women In Supply Chain™ is a personal and shared victory. It’s a shared achievement for me and first step towards the empowerment and inspiration of more Mozambican Women In Supply Chain™. Anything is possible with greater knowledge and visibility. Gaining this type of visibility myself and for other Mozambican women means that anything is possible. We can live what we imagine and dream.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being featured in Women In Supply Chain™ truly is my dream. It’s a great opportunity to prove that I can achieve anything and to show Mozambican women they can be anything they want and to keep going.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>This Women In Supply Chain™ feature was made possible by our sponsor, <a href=\"https://www.apexglobe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Apex Logistic</a>s.

She has been hailed with a broad deluge of honors and awards including coming in as a finalist for </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transport and Logistics Lawyer of the Year, Young Maritime Professional of the Year, 30 Under 30 Corporate Counsel</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and was &#8220;highly commended&#8221; for the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DCN Young Achievement Award</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> How did your professional journey lead you to a career in supply chain?</span></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started in-house, fresh, and eager to get stuck into the shipping industry. Working for a shipping line, I had such an amazing experience of day-to-day logistics, which a lot of people, especially attorneys, don&#8217;t get. This unorthodox background shaped my practical and commercial client approach to legal so they can get on with the job of moving cargo (safely!)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then I &#8220;went to the dark side&#8221; (according to carriers) the cargo interest side. The cargo interests didn&#8217;t have access to the tools and the information to keep business momentum with the best possible legal position. I aimed to fill that space.</span></p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> What has leading in a male-dominated industry taught you as an attorney in supply chain?</span></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Honestly? Sometimes it really sucks being in a male-dominated supply chain industry. I can&#8217;t just </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">be </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in the industry. I must be </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a woman </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in the supply chain industry. Some sector pockets are switched on, across-the-board inclusive, and they just &#8220;get it.&#8221; Then others make me fight every day just to be respected in my field. It can be incredibly exhausting, and sometimes I think, why bother? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then I remember how much I love this industry and show up as the best version of myself. Being part of WISTA Australia Inc. helps me feel like I&#8217;m not alone in the fight, and by showing up as my best self, I can inspire women around me to do the same. I can&#8217;t wait until inclusion across the board is so ordinary that we forget about these before-times when we had to talk about breaking gender roles.</span></p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> How have your mentors empowered your career path forward?</span></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;ve had a couple of different mentors, both official and unofficial. They&#8217;ve helped me to navigate the professional world, how and when to fight the fight, and how to show up unapologetically as my authentic self. The boundaries frequently blur. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s difficult to know where they end or begin in corporate. Having mentors guide and help me navigate the changing rules and fluctuating boundaries makes the journey smoother.</span></p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Which woman in supply chain inspires you and why?</span></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despina Panayiotou Theodosiou—the WISTA international President, motivates me to keep going and continually empower others. She leads the entire WISTA organization globally and on a volunteer basis. Despina sees the worst of the industry (from our collective horror stories) and continues to lead with overwhelming kindness and passion. Whenever I feel drained by the state of the industry&#8217;s limitations on gender inclusion, she is always there to hear my frustrations and give me gentle encouragement to keep going. Despina inspires my advocacy in my volunteer role as the WISTA Australia President.</span></p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> When did you first find your voice as a supply chain leader?</span></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had a breakthrough with a new level of clarity when the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) invited me to be a keynote speaker. The association hosted the IMO (International Maritime Organization) Secretary-General, visiting Australia at that event. It took a lot of careful consideration on how I wanted to talk to the IMO theme of &#8220;Empowering Women in the Maritime Community&#8221; while balancing the need to call out current behaviors, look to the future, and empower my female colleagues to push towards this greater goal—collectively. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I became comfortable with being known as a battering ram (or thunderous.) I am passionate about women being able to safely and freely participate across all areas and on all levels of the shipping, maritime, and logistics industry. I won&#8217;t apologize for that.</span></p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> What do you want to tell women looking to dive into supply chain and those already in the industry?</span></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">enough. You are amazing. You are smart. You deserve to be in the supply chain industry—our industry. We need you in this industry—and we need you seen and heard in this industry. You are allowed to be ordinary. You are allowed to be extraordinary. I want you just to be you. That is enough—you are enough. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Showing up as yourself *is* diversity. Do not let anyone bully you out of the industry if this is what you want to do. There is a place for you here in supply chain where the devastating talent gap is crying for more talent and new approaches to leadership. Join your local WISTA chapter if you want to do more—meet other women to support and support you.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Rally around each other because together we can move mountains, and we will.</span></p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What have you learned on your supply chain journey so far?</span></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;ve learned that the right people will welcome my knowledge, enthusiasm, and values—values they share and actively reinforce. One such group is a group of industry friends and colleagues that we call the (virtual) Happy Hour Crew. I&#8217;ve never met one of this fantastic bunch in person, but they encourage me, support me, cheer me on, and are my safety net—one that stretches across the globe. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of allowing negative voices to overpower mine, I&#8217;ve grown to lift my gaze above the watermark and look forward to the future. Ahead of us is more fun, more shipping, and more innovation. The law doesn&#8217;t have to be dull either. Now I feel more confident than ever to push forward rebranding the concept of lawyers, especially in the shipping industry. *Confetti throw* Suez Canal memes for everyone!</span></p>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What does it mean to you to be featured in our Women In Supply Chain™ Series?</span></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It means a great deal to be recognized as someone of influence and a face and force of positive change in the supply chain.

These female leaders are building back smarter. At Let’s Talk Supply Chain, we know the importance of women tapping into our collective power by supporting one another to shape a more accepting, inclusive industry and professional community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When we rally behind each other, women make things happen—opening doors and breaking out of the status quo and dated gender roles. At Let’s Talk Supply Chain we’re committed to doing our part every month. We’re proud to feature the trailblazing women supply chain leaders and their bold moves to achieve a stronger more resilient supply chain and community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In our Women In Supply Chain™ series, we introduce the women who are dominating supply chain. We ask what and who motivates them and how they’re doing their part to create positive change in their organizations, industry, and community. Let’s Talk Supply Chain shares the obstacles these women have conquered, their big leaps of faith, and the beginnings that ultimately led them to where they are today, leading organizations across the global supply chain. Read on for inspiring stories, career advice, and expert guidance on breaking into the chain.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This month, we’re honored to feature CEO, thought leader, and keynote speaker, </span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandracamposnyc/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sandra Campos.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Sandra has emerged as a powerful advocate for retail innovation, diversity, and female empowerment in the workplace—appearing on MSNBC, Bloomberg, and Telemundo to touch on these critical areas ripe for progress. Sandra has been named a 2021 Latina of Influence, a 2021 Female Founders Alliance Champion, and included in the Top 100 Latina Leaders by </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Latino Leaders Magazine</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. How did your professional journey lead you to a career in supply chain?</span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started my career in retail—on the sales floor and in the buying office. I was able to move to wholesale as an in-store merchandiser and account executive for retailers. My career path took off in sales; to leadership; and ultimately to the ranks of CEO of iconic retail brands. When the pandemic hit, with an opportunity to dig deeper into all the foundational elements that impact a product’s gross margin and the ultimate consumer experience, I pivoted from retail to supply chain. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s much more complicated than many people think, although I also believe that this wave of critical business restructuring requires a rethinking of these complications. Simplification and digitization have transformed other aspects of business execution and the shift towards automation and tech stacks that simplify workstreams will be game-changers.</span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. What have you learned as a woman in a male-dominated industry?</span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s important for companies and leaders to embrace change, to focus on a purposeful organization, and to empower women to advance their initiatives. As an industry, we need to provide a safe space for women to be able to vocalize their opinions without retribution, to be able to take their skills to another level, and to promote from within in supply chain. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Supply Chain, we need educational programs to help empower talent from the warehouse level to the executive level. There are countless Women In Supply Chain™ who are intimidated by the “unknown”. We need to break it down and open the doors to more women and women of color to have a more equitable balance of opportunity for the future.</span></p>\n<h4>3. Have mentors supported you in your roles in retail and transition to supply chain?</h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes. I believe mentors exist everywhere if you try to find them. I learn from both more and less seasoned colleagues, and peers. The key is being open to learning and embracing new concepts. So many strategies can apply across industry sectors—sometimes you don’t have to reinvent the wheel, but you need to be aware and willing enough to take the risks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Giving others space, a voice, and opportunities provided mentorship, but one also needs coaches, advocates, and sponsors who take you along their journey.</span></p>\n<h4>4. Who in supply chain inspires you and why?</h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shekar Natarajan of American Eagle and Jeannine D’Onofrio, formerly of Tommy Hilfiger come to mind, as well as Stephen Denton of Ware2Go. They are all next-generation thinkers whose actions align with their words. They are leaders who are constantly pushing for progress.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve witnessed Shekar’s openness to new ways of doing things first-hand, continually striving to reach future goals. He’s always ten steps ahead of the competition. Jeannine is magnetic, dynamic, and builds strong relationships while being incredibly team-oriented. She takes the time to teach and engage her team so that they, too, can become supply chain leaders.</span></p>\n<h4>5. When did you first find your voice as a supply chain leader?</h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Years of industry experience, failures, and successes have given me a stronger voice today. For me, knowledge equals confidence, and I am a life-long learner. I subscribe to every newsletter possible to absorb what’s happening across sectors and industries whether it’s tech, retail, supply chain, culture, education. I apply it all to my strategic thoughts. Becoming an expert at something takes time and that’s when your voice becomes strongest.</span></p>\n<h4>6. What other advice do you have for women entering the supply chain?</h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I always tell people to work hard, educate yourself constantly, and don’t be afraid to ask for help. Networking is crucial and it is even more important in male-dominated industries like supply chain. Seize the opportunities that are presented, take some risks if you can, and don’t take failures as disappointments. Instead, always learn from failure, building back stronger and smarter for the future.</span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7. What does it mean to you to be featured in our Women In Supply Chain™ Series?</span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transitioning from retail operations to supply chain isn’t common. I’m thrilled to welcome the opportunity to share my journey with others who can learn to pivot and find purposes in the most important sector, supply chain. As someone who supports leaders who empower diversity, momentum, and positive progress, it’s an honor to be featured alongside other woman leaders with the same values and mindset in supply chain.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>About The Author:</strong></h3>\n<p><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-7115 alignleft\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image0-300x240.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"240\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image0-300x240.jpeg 300w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image0-600x481.jpeg 600w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image0.jpeg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" />Naomi Garnice is the Director of Marketing for <a title=\"MicroAge\" href=\"https://microage.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://microage.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1579626018296000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEQIUcfmpLb2AdR2zbPRVza9CjlrQ\">MicroAge</a> where she leads the marketing team and creative strategy.

Keep reading for deep leadership insights and expert guidance on how to become a supply chain leader.</p>\n<p>This month, we’re honored to feature SCM educator and Ph.D. candidate, Sehrish Huma, a supply chain thought leader with a master&#8217;s in logistics and supply chain management. Sehrish is a faculty member at the University of Karachi and a youth representative at VCARE, helping others make their start in supply chain. Her articles have appeared across global industry journals and blogs with a focus on applying practical supply chain experience to her SCM industry knowledge.</p>\n<h4>1. What led you to a career educating others in supply chain?</h4>\n<p>I have come full circle. I started my career studying as an MBA in specialized supply chain management at the University of Karachi KUBS department. My options were limited. Achieving an MBA in supply chain management wasn’t my first choice. I settled on the discipline, for the time being, and then I started learning about SCM and its importance. Learning that we can’t source, make, or even buy a product without a supply chain changed my mindset about SCM. I realized that every dollar businesses earn is fueled by each organization’s supply chain. Understanding the gravity and dire importance of a resilient supply chain, I fell in love with SCM and wanted to build my career in it. But breaking into the supply chain industry was challenging. It took a lot of effort to be recognized both nationally and at a global level.</p>\n<p>I started my career interning at a purchasing department from a renowned multinational pharmaceutical company. During my internship, I gained critical, practical experience on the ground. For the first time, I was able to see Purchase Requisitions (PR), Purchase Orders (PO), Goods Receiving Notes (GRN), and how to follow up for timely payment. It was an amazing learning experience, and my performance and contributions were recognized—my internship was extended. I recognized the need to assess other options and gain visibility in the industry and started SCM, logistics, and risk management research while applying my practical experience. I published my academic research in different international journals.</p>\n<p>I love writing, so while I started gaining global industry recognition, I decided to share my knowledge with the world. I started writing blogs for different international institutes to broaden my reach and exposure. I had been writing for a leading supply chain institute magazine for over a year. In 2019, I was awarded for “contribution to the institute”.</p>\n<p>That year I was busy working in many disciplines across supply chain and started gaining greater traction and visibility among supply chain professionals. I had growing opportunities to lecture at renowned universities. That’s when I stepped into my role as an academic lecturer in supply chain working with different universities. Currently, I have tenure as a full-time faculty member at the University of Karachi Business School.</p>\n<h4>2. What have you learned as a woman in a male-dominated industry?</h4>\n<p>While I have advocates in many of my male supervisors, there are very few women actively recognized for their work in supply chain. I experienced some of that discrimination early in my career when I had the opportunity to interview at a leading 3PL logistics company. I was excited to hear that I was shortlisted as a candidate for an operations role at the organization. But when I appeared for the interview, the recruiting manager and operations manager just looked at me and asked how I—as a young woman—could do an operations job that is 24/7. They made these assumptions based on my gender and age. I told them I’d do my best if they gave me one chance, they didn’t. They assumed that being a young woman, I couldn’t manage the company’s 24/7 operations.</p>\n<p>Even though I didn’t get the job there, I didn’t give up. I wasn’t going to let their dated mindset hold me back. I continued looking for opportunities while sharing my SCM philosophies and knowledge via academic research papers and blogs for different international institutes. Building my visibility as a thought leader opened more doors for me with universities, other institutes, and influencers. As a woman in a male-dominated industry like supply chain, it’s important to keep going and to get comfortable advocating for yourself. Because often women leaders in supply chain must go above and beyond expectations for their male counterparts in the same roles.</p>\n<p>Supply chain is a male-dominated industry, (when I interned there were only two other women in the entire department). Even in many universities, there are still very few female instructors teaching supply chain management. Regardless, I know I’m making a difference for future supply chain leaders when I enlighten my students on the importance of SCM. They learn that supply chain management isn’t just about buying and selling, it’s about every aspect of your business operations. A business can’t survive without a resilient supply chain. Students appreciate my new approach, passion, and energy around SCM. I know I’m spreading that enthusiasm and knowledge around, and in that way I know I’ve succeeded.</p>\n<h4>3. How have your mentors supported your career growth in supply chain?</h4>\n<p>I’ve always had male mentors guiding me on gaining confidence in my abilities. Talking to someone who has shared experience in your field of interest before you build a career there—in this case, supply chain—is critical. In fact, when I meet students and young professionals, I always encourage them to reach out to me. I make it very clear upfront that I am always open to having a supply chain discussion with them.</p>\n<h4>4. Who in supply chain inspires you and why?</h4>\n<p>There are so many remarkable Women In Supply Chain™ to be inspired by because they are doing important work in the industry. When I started my career, I came across one wonderful supply chain lady—the one and only Sarah Barnes-Humphrey. I started my career witnessing her dedication and the ongoing obstacles she faced on her journey in supply chain. I learned a lot from Sarah.</p>\n<p>She taught me not to give up, to stay motivated, and how to be consistent. Sarah taught me how to stay connected to others in the supply chain community, keeping everyone current on news and best practices. Most importantly, she taught me how to celebrate every achievement—big and small. It’s easy to overlook the small achievements. But they’re important. If you publicly share and celebrate even your smallest achievements, others will join in the celebration. I appreciate the way Sarah celebrates and supports Women In Supply Chain™. She’s supported me a lot and I admire her humble, courageous, and practical nature.</p>\n<h4>5. When did you first find your voice as a supply chain leader?</h4>\n<p>As everyone else has probably also experienced, I realized that the world has changed now. Initially, even after I amassed the knowledge and expertise, there was no visibility of me or my work. I was advised to expand my social media presence and personal brand by networking on LinkedIn. Back then it was challenging to make valuable and relatable connections. I remember at the start of my career I had just 20 connections in my professional network. Gradually I started making connections, commenting, and interacting with supply chain professionals.</p>\n<p>I started sharing my ideas on supply chain management and then one day I received an offer from an international institute to write for its blog. That day was the happiest one. I felt like I did it, it was an amazing feeling. Recently, I’ve also been associated as a youth supply chain representative at VCARE Academy in Canada. These opportunities assure me that yes, I’m on the right track.</p>\n<h4>6. What other advice do you have for women entering the supply chain?</h4>\n<p>My journey is not different from any other women who have some spark in themselves—those women who have the courage to do something big that excites them. And yes, face rejection, misunderstandings, and discouragement along the way. I’ve faced them all, but the one thing that keeps me going is my constant eagerness to learn new things. I never let a setback hurt my momentum. In fact, hearing “no” from any organization motivates me to find a better organization that values me, my knowledge, and my passion for SCM.</p>\n<p>Just don’t give up, always keep trying. One day those connections fall into place. It’s started happening for me. The firms that rejected me early in my career as a young woman in supply chain are now looking for consultation on their operations. They want my expert tips and insights via guest sessions for their employees on how to handle uncertainties in operations. Because supply chain operations are so unpredictable, and you can’t forecast everything with 100% accuracy.</p>\n<p>The future is all about supply chain. As this industry has been brutally impacted by the pandemic. The economy and the industry need supply chainers whether they are men or women. Being a supply chain professional, we are on a test to keep our operations robust and try to make the supply chain industry more resilient together. Right now, I’m fully invested in leading in the supply chain domain. I will keep making a difference by sharing knowledge as a researcher, lecturer, blogger, and supply chain representative.</p>\n<h4>7. What advice do you have for other women looking to break into supply chain?</h4>\n<p>The most important thing that I’d recommend to all young women is, if you think you and your ideas aren’t appreciated where you work then change your workplace. You aren’t a tree that can only grow in one place. Move around till you find the place where you can be appreciated for being you. As a young generation, we have the right mix of knowledge and skills. Just be confident and be you because the world needs the real and passionate you.</p>\n<h4>8. What does it mean to you to be featured in our Women In Supply Chain™ Series?</h4>\n<p>It seems like a dream come true. What else could a passionate supply chain enthusiast want? I’ve read several supply chain leaders’ interesting and inspiring stories from the Women In Supply Chain™ series. It’s helped me and given me the courage to be consistent and never give up. The supply chain industry desperately needs these platforms to share women leaders’ achievements and challenges. They are proof that you can be you in supply chain.</p>\n<h2><strong>Meet Our Sponsor</strong></h2>\n<p>This Women In Supply Chain™ feature was made possible by our sponsor, <a href=\"https://www.apexglobe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Apex Logistics</a>.

Amanda is also the Director of Operations at Snipitz, a software that enables attendees of live streams to choose camera angles for optimal event viewing.

I had no idea what it was and when perusing job postings, I saw a position for a “buyer” and thought, I like buying things. A week later, I had an interview. A day after the interview, I had the job. That was almost twenty years ago, and I have never looked back.</p>\n<p>My career has been a series of adventures with the support of male and female champions alike. One of the best parts of procurement is getting involved in almost everything going on in the company. I took full advantage—leading large transformations, M&amp;A, technology deployments, insourcing and outsourcing, process changes, change management, and more. Those opportunities sparked connections with some of the most amazing people, traveling the world, and led me to where I am now.</p>\n<p>Through my organization, Wonder Services, I am supporting organizations with their change efforts as a consultant. I am also the Director of Operations at Snipitz, a live-event-experience startup.</p>\n<h3>Over the last two decades, what have you learned as a woman in a male-dominated industry?</h3>\n<p>I never invested energy or time focusing on being the only woman in the room, instead, I focused on listening and learning. I committed to giving my best possible work, serving others, and earning trust in key relationships. It’s been incredibly fulfilling to see more and more women succeeding in supply chain in and outside of work.</p>\n<h3>How have your mentors supported you throughout your professional adventures?</h3>\n<p>Yes, I’ve been fortunate to have several champions—female and male—throughout my career. These were never relationships that we officially labeled as mentorships. Instead, they were people who I grew to trust, who trust me and know me—my goals, aspirations, strengths, and weaknesses. So, they can represent me and advocate for me even if I’m not in the room.</p>\n<h3>Who motivates you and why?</h3>\n<p>I’m constantly impressed and inspired by all the women entrepreneurs I connect with and come across in Supply Chain. There are so many who are making a difference to support and grow our profession. They have helped me navigate my personal entrepreneurial journey like a guiding light.</p>\n<h3>When did you first find your voice as a procurement leader?</h3>\n<p>There have been many game-changing moments in my career that have helped me find my voice. One memory that stands out helped me find my voice and shape my leadership style for years to come. While attending a women’s conference a speaker said, “As a leader, if you aren’t spending a third of your time developing yourself, you will not be able to do the same for your team.” At the time, I was a new leader and mother, and I wasn’t spending any time on my personal professional development—zero! I started reading books, strategically taking speaking opportunities, writing and posting on LinkedIn, and networking more internally and externally. It empowered me to level up my leadership capabilities.</p>\n<h4>What have you learned on your procurement journey?</h4>\n<p>I’ve learned that motion creates opportunity. Don’t let any boxes from expectations of others or the ones you put yourself in limit you. Go do something new. Take an opportunity that feels beyond you—face the Imposter Syndrome head-on—go. Talk to someone new; tackle a dream or goal. Go <em>do</em>, whatever that means to you. You won’t regret it.</p>\n<h4>What other advice do you have for women entering the supply chain?</h4>\n<p>Enjoy the change, look for opportunities, and cherish the relationships that you cultivate in the process. We are living through a large transformation in supply chain right now. It’s one of the most exciting and challenging times to be in supply chain.</p>\n<h4>What does it mean to you to be featured in our Women In Supply Chain™ Series?</h4>\n<p>I am humbled to be included in the series. There are so many amazingly talented women in the supply chain—growing in ranks every day. Having opportunities to share experiences enables all of us to learn from each other and continue making strides. This series does that so effectively, I’m proud to be a part of that.</p>\n<h2><strong>Meet Our Sponsor</strong></h2>\n<p>This Women In Supply Chain™ feature was made possible by our sponsor, <a href=\"https://www.apexglobe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Apex Logistics</a>.

Read on for inspiring stories, career advice, and expert guidance on breaking into the chain.</p>\n<p>This month we’re proud to feature Stephany Lapierre, chief executive officer and founder at Tealbook, a technology provider harnessing AI and machine learning (ML) to deliver smarter procurement approaches. Stephany has worked in procurement for over two decades and has more than a decade of leadership experience. She has been recognized as one of the Top 100 Most Influential Women In Supply Chain™, and her business has recently been hailed by Gartner with the Cool Vendor Award and by Spend Matters as one of the Top 50 Companies to Watch.</p>\n<p>Over the last decade, Stephany has built a successful strategic sourcing and procurement firm to empower her mission of delivering a ‘Trusted Source of Supplier Data’. She plays an active role as a thought leader and in her local community and sits on the boards for The International Association for Data Quality Governance and Analytics (IADQGA) and on the C-Sweet for Corporate Successful Women Executives and Emerging Talent at Georgia Tech Research Institute.</p>\n<h2>How did your supply chain journey start and what drove you to launch Tealbook?</h2>\n<p>Before Tealbook, I spent a decade building a successful strategic sourcing and procurement consulting firm focused on large-scale sourcing optimization projects. I witnessed failed enterprise software solution implementations and became convinced that these failures and friction were not caused by the software itself, but by the lack of quality data available. Within complex enterprises, I couldn’t see how data issues could be resolved by adding more software. More software created the opposite effect, duplications, disconnected, silo and static information, lengthy processes, expensive services, etc. One question haunted me: <i>what was the cost of bad supplier data to the enterprise? </i>Whichever direction I looked, the cost kept adding up and it was immense (hundreds of millions of dollars to the enterprise).</p>\n<p>I could see the solution clearly but spent nine years trying to poke holes at it and gain the courage to do something about it. In 2015, the market started to change and cloud technologies were being adopted by all software providers claiming that cloud software would digitize the procurement function. I couldn’t see how disparate systems that still required services and portals could. Machine learning concepts were still immature, but I was fortunate to have found a CTO who could bring my vision to life. We could use ML and AI to proactively create supplier information without requiring third-party services or depending on suppliers to update and maintain portals. It was game-changing.</p>\n<p>The journey to build and grow Tealbook was challenging, as we created a new platform category that could autonomously enhance data for every supplier in the world. Today, Tealbook is recognized as the ‘supplier data foundation’ that optimizes enterprises’ investment in software, people, and suppliers. We partner with Fortune 500 companies across multiple sectors including pharmaceuticals, manufacturing, financial services, higher education, and technologies.</p>\n<h2>Tell us about your commitment to building a more diverse and inclusive supply chain.</h2>\n<p>Not only is the supply chain industry historically male-dominated, but it’s also rare to be a woman founder/CEO at the helm of an AI technology company. I strongly believe that being a woman founder is a huge competitive advantage to hiring top talent. At Tealbook, we have been committed to and intentional about building a diverse team. Tealbook has a 50/50 female to male ratio across our board, our leadership, and the general workforce. Diverse teams perform better with a broad spectrum of opinions, experiences, and perspectives.</p>\n<p>As a company leader, I need to build core values and define the type of company that people will be proud to work for and eventually have on their resume.</p>\n<h2>How has this commitment extended to shaping your company values and culture?</h2>\n<p>My leadership consists of four themes to unite and inspire our employees:</p>\n<p>The first is Teamwork. The impact we have is always greater when we work together. We bring our authentic selves, unique experiences, perspectives, and passions across teams, functions, and geographies to solve problems and deliver better results.</p>\n<p>Next, trust through transparency. We build trust by communicating honestly, authentically, and with respect. We hold ourselves accountable, we admit to our mistakes, and do what we say we’ll do. Our success is deeply rooted in building trust through open and clear transparency.</p>\n<p>Also, delight. We are all customers. We listen to needs, we challenge our ideas of what’s possible, and prioritize work that will drive success and build satisfaction. We constantly look for ways to differentiate ourselves and create a lasting impact and impression.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the Will the Win. Change is the only constant, we don’t just believe this, we take on the unknown. We dare to challenge the status quo, continuously adapt, change, and evolve. We act with urgency; aligning our priorities with the company deliverables and drive decisions backed by data.</p>\n<h2>How did you find your voice as a supply chain leader? How can other women leaders in the making find theirs?</h2>\n<p>It has been a series of moments. Early on I thought other people would have the answers or would somehow know better than me because they might have built a tech company before or have more technical experience. While I listen to others and openly accept feedback, I also learned to trust my instincts—that’s something any woman leader needs to do.</p>\n<p>Own your instincts. They are usually right and can give you the confidence to recognize that you are exactly where you should be now.</p>\n<h2>Have you had any mentors who helped you along the way?</h2>\n<p>In my career, I’ve been extremely fortunate to have many wonderful mentors, advisors, and colleagues. I am proud to create and actively partner and collaborate with a stellar board of directors, investors, and a network of tech founders. I couldn’t have found a better group of individuals to support my journey from founder to CEO and vision for building a massively successful company.</p>\n<h2>Who has inspired you in supply chain?</h2>\n<p>It’s hard to pick one person, I learn and get inspired by so many people. I admire Dr. Elouise Epstein for challenging our industry and speaking openly about the shift that needs to occur to achieve digital procurement success. I sat through one of her presentations at ISM four years ago as she was presenting the future of our digital technology ecosystem with a white box in the middle of her slide. I thought “ that’s it! This is Tealbook! We are that supplier data foundation that sits right in the middle of an integrated technology ecosystem”.</p>\n<p>While it was still early and the market hadn’t caught up yet, it was a huge validation for me that such a prominent thought leader was seeing the world the same way as I was and confirmed that we were heading in the right direction.</p>\n<h2>What have you learned about yourself as a leader on your journey in supply chain and procurement?</h2>\n<p>I have learned that no matter the challenge, there is always a path forward. Building a tech company is incredibly consuming and requires an abundance of conviction for the problem you are solving. Passion is contagious. It attracts customers, investors, and talent. When you have a dream to make the industry better, most people are incredibly generous and want to support it and share in it. People are not all motivated the same way and understanding that goes a long way in driving a more accepting and engaged workplace.</p>\n<p>Self-care matters also. Finding balance and personal satisfaction is necessary to be a good leader.</p>\n<h2>What have you learned from the pandemic disruption over the last year and a half?</h2>\n<p>When COVID hit, our team wanted to help and came up with the idea of providing free relevant supplier lists with contact information to any organization facing supply chain disruptions. We all got behind it and were able to execute fast enough to support 170+ organizations desperately looking for suppliers just in the first few weeks.</p>\n<p>We worked to help Brooks Brothers find suppliers of raw ingredients to produce</p>\n<p>over 100,000 N95 masks in record time and help the UK identify over 60,000 ISO-certified PPE manufacturers in Asia. This initiative received a lot of media attention including two articles in Forbes while more than doubling our business pipeline in two weeks.</p>\n<h2>What causes are top of mind for you and your business?</h2>\n<h2>Black Lives Matter hit home in many ways but mostly impacted our African American employees. Taking the time to understand the history and impact on the Black community was enlightening</h2>\n<p>to all of us. I asked them for guidance on how to respond as a CEO and on behalf of Tealbook. One of the most powerful things our Director of Marketing said was, “Silence is the real problem. We don’t ask you to be perfect allies, just to be an ally.” I knew at that moment that we needed to do something.</p>\n<p>Within days, we offered the market free access to Tealbook to access over 32,000 certified African American suppliers at no cost to improve access and opportunities. We also made a statement about our values and beliefs for justice and equality.</p>\n<h2>What advice do you have for future supply chain leaders?</h2>\n<p>Find something you absolutely love and go all in. It doesn’t matter what it is but if you love what you do, you will always thrive to be better at it. It will never feel like work. So, get out of your way and go for it.</p>\n<h2>What does being featured in Women In Supply Chain™ mean to you?</h2>\n<p>I am honored to be featured in the Women In Supply Chain™ Series. We need to recognize and elevate women for their achievements more often—make it the norm. Regular recognition and empowerment are vital to inspiring other women to take on leadership roles or launch their own businesses.</p>\n<p>As a mother of three daughters and the CEO &amp; founder of an AI tech company with 50/50 gender equity, I want to contribute to seeing more women at the top by sharing my experiences, supporting other women, and learning from them. Because as women in supply change we can only go further—together.</p>\n<p>This Women In Supply Chain™ feature was made possible by our sponsor, <a href=\"https://www.apexglobe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Apex Logistics</a> . <b><i>Apex Logistics International Inc is deep-rooted in diversity and culture, led by our own “Woman In Supply Chain” CEO, Elsie Qian; these values are why we partnered with Let’s Talk Supply Chain for the Women In Supply Chain™ series.  Apex is recognized as one of the fastest-growing Top 25 airfreight forwarders in the world, with a network of over 2500 global employees in more than 70 countries.</i></b></p>\n<h3>ABOUT THE AUTHOR:</h3>\n<p><strong>Naomi Garnice</strong> is the Director of Marketing for <a title=\"MicroAge\" href=\"https://microage.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://microage.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1581639384712000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH_8KjfyQWKKNrM5J335GTVpkeHRg\">MicroAge</a> where she leads the marketing team and creative strategy.

Jacquelyn leads Starbucks’ end-to-end supply chain strategy for beverage ingredients, food packaging, and Siren Retail categories. Her leadership connects the Global Supply chain functions and the product, R&amp;D, and retail operations teams. A Duke graduate and MBA, Jacquelyn boasts over two decades of global supply chain and procurement experience at global food and beverage titans and more than thirty years in total in corporate positions.</p>\n<p>Jacquelyn currently serves as a board member for Seattle Goodwill Industries, the Intralox China Advisory Board, and the Intralox US Food Safety Board. She is a relentless advocate for the Seattle Arts and Museums and serves on the Capital Campaign Cabinet for the Seattle Girls&#8217; School. She has been hailed with numerous recognitions for her leadership and work in supply chain, including most recently, The Top 100 Women In Supply Chain™ 2021.</p>\n<h2>How did your supply chain journey start?</h2>\n<p>A girl from Ohio who went to Duke to study biomedical engineering to become a surgeon proceeded to get her MBA from the University of Delaware and then continued to become a stronger business leader with every experience that followed. From working in Direct Sales and Marketing for Dupont’s Textile Fiber Division to going on to major food and beverage organizations like McDonald’s and Starbucks to make an impact by forging a more connected supply chain. I moved, traveled, lived abroad, hired, and mentored many on their way up while balancing work with family and life along the way.</p>\n<h2>How did you find your purpose?</h2>\n<p>I found purpose, standing up and speaking out on behalf of those who may not have the voice, social capital, or ability to do so. When it was easier but wrong to stay silent when things were being done without the lens of values and ethics, I found myself standing up to align values with business operations.</p>\n<p>My professional <em>why </em>is leading teams of professionals accountable for building safer more ethical, and sustainable supply chains using change management strategies and metric-fueled approaches.</p>\n<h2>How would your colleagues describe you and what are you known for?</h2>\n<p>Agile, persuasive, imaginative, and always calm under pressure. I have a proven track record of delivering best-in-class processes, engaging teams, eliminating costs, and powering a go-to-market mindset to accelerate gross profits and results. Over my career, I’ve worked to rebuild supply chain teams and develop category expertise, bolstering retention rates and a commitment to sustainable succession planning.</p>\n<h2>What are some of your standout achievements?</h2>\n<p>At McDonald’s, my supply chain optimization strategies resulted in a collective benefit of over 150 million dollars in annual savings. I dedicated myself to a rigorous supplier performance measurement process, increased U.S. supply chain supplier diversity, and mentored several up-and-comers. In my current role as Vice President, Direct Sourcing – Global Supply Chain at Starbucks, I lead, optimize, develop, recommend, and innovate supply chain solutions for the direct sourcing business categories, develop talent, and ensure excellence in go-to-market execution—every step of the way.</p>\n<h2>What’s one surprising sourcing best practice you’ve learned?</h2>\n<p>As the Senior Director of Strategic Sourcing in the U.S. Supply Chain Management department for McDonald’s, it wasn’t unusual for an owner of a supplier company to meet with our U.S. president or chair of the board. Suppliers are that important. This was part of our three-legged approach with the legs being corporate staff, franchisees, and the supplier base. You need three strong, resilient legs to keep your business standing through disruption.</p>\n<h2>How have you helped businesses navigate disruption throughout your career?</h2>\n<p>In supply chain and sourcing we navigate disruption daily, we’ve been reminded of this over the last fourteen months. At Mcdonald&#8217;s in Asia, I lead my team in navigating three major business disruption crises and restored supply in record time while establishing better best practices for food safety and quality processes to protect the brand. At Starbucks, I continue in leading my team through the COVID-19 pandemic to a smarter, safer normal.</p>\n<h2>How have your mentors in supply chain helped along the way?</h2>\n<p>Being a woman in supply chain can be challenging, but I’ve succeeded by being courageous and at times embracing big, uncomfortable changes all with support from others in my professional sphere. I’ve had several mentors, coaches, and advisors. They’ve given me insight into my professional potential, removed blinders to help me become more self-aware, and shifted or sometimes removed obstacles and roadblocks. Their thoughts, advice, and care are notable and have been extremely helpful over the years.</p>\n<p>I am inspired by Walgreens CEO, Roz Brewer for her fearless, brilliant, courageous, and empathetic leadership approach to everything on which she leaves her imprint. While her time at Starbucks was short, it was extremely material for my personal career development, our organizational culture enhancement, getting good work done, moving and leading through crisis, and identifying strong talent across all levels at the organization.</p>\n<h2>What advice do you have for future supply chain leaders?</h2>\n<p>Be bold. Have courage as someone needs you to speak your truth and show up as a role model. Be conscious of where you can make a difference and let that drive you—own your values and passions in and outside of the workplace.</p>\n<p>Whether you’re dealing with product demand or a new concept, contingency plans are mission-critical to keeping a watchful eye out for pitfalls and proactively identifying alternative solutions whenever necessary.</p>\n<p>And remember, you already awesome so dream really big.

Let’s Talk Supply Chain highlights the challenges they’ve conquered, their leaps of faith and achievements, and the paths that brought them where they are now, leading organizations across the global supply chain.</p>\n<p>These supply chain leaders share what it’s like breaking out of stereotypes and into leadership roles—breaking glass ceilings across the chain along the way. Keep reading for inspiring stories, career advice, and expert guidance on breaking into the chain.</p>\n<p>This month we’re proud to feature Shana Riggs, a consultant and supply chain executive with experience building processes and high-performance teams across industries and for popular retail brands. With more than two decades of global operations experience, Shana has explored the chain, while crossing cultural divides and gender barriers. Shana has focused her career on empowerment every step of the way—she currently acts as a mentor for supply chain up and comers.</p>\n<h2>How did your supply chain journey start?</h2>\n<p>My supply chain career started at a plastics company managing imports and exports. I focused on Chinese imports and opening two new Mexico-based facilities—a learning opportunity that introduced me to Trade and Compliance.</p>\n<p>Next, I worked as an Import Export Specialist for BAX Global exploring the other side of the business to become a Station General Manager which meant working in sales for a minimum of a year.  And I did before becoming the first female GM in the eastern division. Then Schenker purchased BAX and I left for a new opportunity at ANN INC (Ann Taylor and Loft).</p>\n<p>The retail brand was relocating its logistics team to Louisville, KY where the distribution center was based. At ANN I oversaw International Logistics and later took on Global Logistics.  I was able to hone my Request for Proposal (RFP) and negotiation skills while amassing an incredible global logistics team.</p>\n<p>After Ascena purchased ANN, I accepted the Vice President of Logistics and Trade position at Chico’s in Florida. I was thrilled to have this opportunity, even though it was difficult with my husband and daughter staying behind in Indiana to complete her senior year.  At Chico’s, I enjoyed the challenge of heading up Trade, Global Logistics, and Distribution.</p>\n<h2>Who inspires you?</h2>\n<p>Later in my career, after understanding and appreciating servant leadership, I saw that Shelley Simpson (J.B. Hunt CCO) epitomized it. Executives harnessing servant leadership build a resilient team on empowerment—dedicating themselves to creating opportunities and the ability to succeed.</p>\n<h2>Did you have a supply chain mentor?</h2>\n<p>Outside of my father teaching me the love of negotiation, tenacity, and strong work ethic, I had a strong female mentor early in my career, Ella. She’s an entrepreneur from Hong Kong who owned half a dozen businesses—I worked at each of them. She showed me just how much women can advance their careers while teaching me business sense.</p>\n<h2>Who or what inspires you?</h2>\n<p>There are so many trailblazing Women In Supply Chain™ who I admire including Suzanna Zhu at Hershey, Sandra MacQuillan at Mondelez, and the supply chain leaders at Amazon. I&#8217;m constantly amazed at how these leaders continually innovate and improve the end-to-end supply chain.</p>\n<h2>How have you navigated a male-dominated industry?</h2>\n<p>I had to develop a thick skin early on in my supply chain career. My experience has improved immensely over the years.  Starting, it was difficult always being the only woman in the room and being underestimated.</p>\n<h2>When did you have your breakthrough?</h2>\n<p>I’ve always had a strong voice—from both of my parents—also, a passage in the book Tim S. Grover book, <u>Relentless</u> had a powerful impact on how I handled life when my goal wasn’t being realized.</p>\n<p>The passage is:</p>\n<blockquote><p> “One of the hardest things to do is change course once you’ve set your goals. You made a decision, you worked for it, you earned the payoff… but for whatever reason, it’s not going the way you planned.</p>\n<p>It’s not weak to recognize when it’s time to shift directions.</p>\n<p>It’s weak to refuse to consider other options and fail at everything because you couldn’t adapt to anything.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Be open to change and new directions.</p>\n<h2>What have you learned on your supply chain journey?</h2>\n<p>I’ve found my passion in building winning teams comprised of strong partners with internal and external customers.  I’ve learned that sometimes you need to step back and take a beat to be deliberate. It’s tough to slow down in a fast-paced industry like supply chain.</p>\n<p>This past year I’ve enjoyed consulting, but I miss being part of a global team. With all of the disruption, I am remaining open to the future and new directions.</p>\n<h2>What do you want future supply chain leaders to know?</h2>\n<p>Be tenacious, be prepared for the ups and downs in your career, and learn as much as possible about every aspect of supply chain and the entire business. I am currently mentoring a talented young woman in college, and I give her this advice constantly.</p>\n<h2>What does it mean to you to be featured in Women In Supply Chain™?</h2>\n<p>I’m honored to be featured and hope we can continue promoting more female leaders in all aspects of supply chain. We need to support women on their career paths who are maneuvering the obstacles that come with this crazy, challenging, and unbeatable career.</p>\n<h2><strong>Meet Our Sponsor</strong></h2>\n<p>This Women In Supply Chain™ feature was made possible by our sponsor, <a href=\"https://www.apexglobe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Apex Logistics</a>.

I haven&#8217;t looked back since. I&#8217;ve been fortunate to work in multiple supply chain areas, including sourcing and procurement, and logistics.</p>\n<p>Instead, I’ve been building my knowledge and experience across industries in Fortune 500 companies, including consumer goods and financial services organizations. Currently, I am the COO of an apparel sourcing and production agency—serving American and Canadian customers with production in Asia.</p>\n<p>Now, I’m ready to embark on a new chapter in my supply chain journey.</p>\n<h2>What challenges have you faced in a male-dominated industry?</h2>\n<p>Being a woman in supply chain has been a challenge, but I love a good challenge.  To earn my place at the table, I’ve had to be creative in gaining attention and buy-in from colleagues and executives. Even with the obstacles I&#8217;ve faced as a woman in a production environment, I’m proud of the achievements I’ve made so far.</p>\n<h2>Who helped you navigate these challenges?</h2>\n<p>While I&#8217;ve never had a formal mentor, I&#8217;ve had a couple of advocates who have helped me find my way in being sounding boards, guiding me, and encouraging me to never give up. From giving me career advice and confidence in my abilities to encouraging me to take leaps forward in my career—they’ve shared what worked for them and what could work for me.</p>\n<h2>Who or what inspires you?</h2>\n<p>There are so many trailblazing Women In Supply Chain™ who I admire including Suzanna Zhu at Hershey, Sandra MacQuillan at Mondelez, and the supply chain leaders at Amazon. I&#8217;m constantly amazed at how these leaders continually innovate and improve the end-to-end supply chain.</p>\n<h2>When did you nail your professional voice and style?</h2>\n<p>I found my voice working as a consultant. I was comfortable providing counsel to executives and leading teams. While I&#8217;ve always been great at facilitating, I&#8217;m also an ambivert or an &#8220;extroverted introvert.” The global COVID-19 pandemic offered me new opportunities to expand my network and participate in broader supply chain dialogues—opportunities that weren’t readily available pre-new normal.</p>\n<h2>What’s your favorite part about being in supply chain?</h2>\n<p>I always want to be challenged and keep learning. I always have a new webinar, course, or read teed up to keep growing my knowledge around new trends, case studies, and technologies. I look forward to continuing to advance my supply chain career and following my areas of passion including mitigating supply chain risks and improving the reach of the circular supply chain.</p>\n<h2>What’s your advice for women with big supply chain dreams?</h2>\n<p>Don&#8217;t be deterred by who or what you perceive as obstacles. Instead, try to gain experience in as many functions as possible. Make the time to build meaningful relationships—your network is everything. Get to know more about your colleagues and what your counterparts in marketing and business development do for more visibility.</p>\n<p>Taking everything in and working in as many areas as possible makes you a well-rounded supply chain practitioner. Having deeper visibility into every angle of the chain and what impacts consumer decisions along the way will make you a stronger, smarter leader.</p>\n<p>And remember, you can never be too smart. Embrace a growth mindset hungry for knowledge and never stop learning.</p>\n<h2>What does it mean to you to be featured in Women In Supply Chain™?</h2>\n<p>Being featured in Women In Supply Chain™ shows me that I&#8217;ve finally started to make an impact in the field I love; I’m so honored. Also, it’s a reinforcement and a reminder that there is so much more ahead for me to achieve.</p>\n<p>Being recognized as a voice in supply chain, among other female leaders who are reshaping our industry is inspiring. That inspires me to want to do more.</p>\n<p>I hope this blog inspires more young women to explore supply chain and get active and involved in the industry.

Katy has nearly two decades of supply chain experience and bachelor’s degree in Business Finance and Management from Indiana University South Bend.</p>\n<h2>1. How did you land a career in supply chain?</h2>\n<p>In 2002, when I was a college junior I started with Fastenal—looking for a finance-tailored internship to bolster my resume. The company fit my basic search criteria for internships… business-related and paid. So, I joined the Blue Team, and what started as a summer internship grew into an almost-19-year career. When my internship wrapped up at the end of the summer, I had an offer to stay on as a part-time support team member. Then, early in 2003, I was promoted to assistant general manager at our Mishawaka, Indiana location.</p>\n<p>I was a senior in college with a full-time course load—juggling both a full-time potential career along with a part-time, weekend job at Applebee’s. Being detail-orientated, organized, and laser-focused were mission-critical to maintain my rigorous schedule and my grades while thriving at Fastenal where I learned everything I could from business members. In December of 2003, that dedication and focus paid off when I accepted the role of general manager in Goshen, Indiana.</p>\n<p>I ran the Goshen location for two and a half years, expanding our business in the market and earning the top-performing location award. My proven leadership and success propelled me to the district manager position, a role I supported with pride for 13 years before landing my current role, vice president of the Lake Michigan region in January of 2019.</p>\n<h2>2. What has your experience been as a woman in a male-dominated industry?</h2>\n<p>This one is challenging for me because my experience has been like those around me. Yes, I’ve had the occasional customer make a disparaging remark regarding my sex, and I would fire right back. I was determined that I wouldn’t let that affect me.</p>\n<p>And a lot of that comes down to the support system of leaders I had at Fasten. I’ve been fortunate to work with an incredible leadership team since starting with the company. My managers recognized my inner drive and tailored their coaching to motivate and push me forward. I am the first female regional vice president for Fastenal, and I take pride in my achievements because what motivates me is that I’m creating that opportunity for the next generation.</p>\n<h2>3. Many women struggle to advance because they can’t find a mentor. Have you had a supply chain mentor and how did they help empower growth in your career?</h2>\n<p>Yes, Randy Miller, now a regional vice president at Fastenal played a vital role in my development as an individual and a leader there. With over three decades at Fastenal, Randy knew the organization and industry culture and trends. He challenged me whenever necessary, guided me when applicable, and has supported me throughout my career. His mentoring helped me dial in my leadership style. I am grateful for Randy’s influence and guidance over the years.</p>\n<h2>4. What traits do you most admire in others?</h2>\n<p>I admire any individual who has worked from the ground floor up, showing their inner strength and grit to achieve success. Those are the people—and the stories—that inspire me most and the ones I relate to with my history in supply chain.</p>\n<h2>5. How did you find your path to supply chain?</h2>\n<p>I learned at a young age that my path was mine to create through my decisions. We live and learn from our mistakes and triumphs, and while we can learn from others, nothing replaces personal experience. I don’t believe I “found&#8221; my voice or path, instead, I had to discover and build confidence in the value I offer. Early in my career, I realized that I could bring value, even in a male-dominated industry. It was up to me to make my voice heard.</p>\n<h2>6. What advice do you have for up-and-coming leaders looking to break into the supply chain?</h2>\n<p>There is no substitute for plain hard work. The journey will be challenging, you will face adversity and setbacks—learn from these. Be knowledgeable, be resilient, and have a plan. You can achieve anything you set your mind to with grit and dedication.</p>\n<p>Use your voice; you have valuable insight and ideas, share them. Be confident in yourself, and ready to evolve and change with your business goals and environment. Any goal you want to achieve is possible with dedication, hard work, and yes, sometimes a little bit of luck.</p>\n<h2>7. What’s your next big goal in supply chain?</h2>\n<p>Over the past two decades, I’ve grown and continued learning from everyone around me. Each great Fastenal story starts with a phenomenal person. These are the people who have shaped me into the person I am today.</p>\n<p>My next goal is sharing my story and striving to be a mentor and motivator—helping to develop more up-and-coming and impactful leaders at Fastenal. The most important lesson I&#8217;ve learned is to trust the team I’ve built around me. When you have the right people in the right positions, anything is possible. I’m positive my future is going to be full of surprises, achievements, and even the occasional setbacks that will drive my continuing career with Fastenal.</p>\n<h2><strong>Meet Our Sponsor</strong></h2>\n<p>This Women In Supply Chain™ feature was made possible by our sponsor, Fastenal.

    "content": "<p><strong>So, let’s get started with your journey &#8211; what are your earliest career memories, how did you get into supply chain and how did you get to where you are now?</strong></p>\n<p>I grew up in Georgia and earned my bachelor’s degree in political science from Georgia Southern University. My first foray into government relations began in the Georgia Governor’s Office of Planning and Budget as a policy analyst before moving to South Carolina to serve as the director of government relations for the Charleston Metro Chamber of Commerce. These roles made a great foundation for joining the South Carolina Ports Authority in 1998 to focus on government relations. I worked as the vice president of government relations, and then as the senior vice president of external affairs, overseeing all aspects of public, community, and government relations for the maritime agency.</p>\n<p>I became fascinated with the maritime industry and worked over the years to gain a deeper understanding of the port and maritime community—investing time to learn all aspects of the operations and the people behind the jobs that keep freight moving. I earned a Masters in Business Administration in Global Supply Chain from the University of Tennessee’s Haslam School of Business. I became the senior vice president of operations and terminals in 2015 before stepping into my current role as the port’s first chief operating officer in 2018.</p>\n<p>In my role as COO, I oversee terminal operations, carrier sales, information technology and support services, crane and equipment maintenance, engineering, environmental, Port Police, procurement, the Logistics Solutions Center, cruise operations, government relations, and communications.</p>\n<p>It has been rewarding to watch our port grow over the past two decades into a top 10 U.S. container port that is known for efficiency, reliability, and customized solutions. This year is particularly meaningful for me, as many of our long-planned infrastructure projects are coming online, all while our amazing workforce continues to keep supply chains fluid while facing unprecedented challenges. It is an honor to work alongside our team and the broader maritime community.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you consider being some of the biggest risks you took in your career?</strong></p>\n<p>Since 2011, I have led the Charleston Harbor Deepening Project for SC Ports—a hugely important initiative for both SC Ports and South Carolina. It is a research-intensive project that involves great collaboration among many regulatory agencies. It was paramount to successfully convey the importance of deepening Charleston Harbor to our federal, state, and local partners to secure support and funding. I worked closely with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers &#8211; Charleston District on the extensive permitting and approvals processes. This project has taught me the power of collaboration as we work with federal, state, and local governments, as well as resource agencies and community partners.</p>\n<p>The $558 million project is now fully funded—thanks to our S.C. Legislature, Congressional delegation, and the Obama and Trump administrations, as well as the Army Corps of Engineers.  The project is on track to achieve 52 feet of depth this year, with completion slated for 2022. The 52-foot depth will ensure the port’s global competitiveness, benefitting S.C. businesses for decades to come. To see this project being realized after a decade of hard work and partnership is deeply rewarding.</p>\n<p><strong>What challenges did you have along the way?</strong></p>\n<p>Everything we undertake at SC Ports involves great collaboration. It is crucial that our workforce feels motivated, valued, and empowered. We are constantly looking to grow leaders from within and encouraging our teammates to be decisive.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you have any tips for other women to help overcome challenges that come up along the way?</strong></p>\n<p>My tips apply to anyone overcoming challenges in their career:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take the time to know your business and the people in your organization. This enables you to find solutions and take on challenging projects that further growth. Learn how to get to “yes” when so many people are used to saying “no.”</li>\n<li>Be decisive.</li>\n<li>Celebrate the victories.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>As an industry, how far do you think we have come when it comes to diversity and what can we do to help moving the needle forward?</strong></p>\n<p>We have made great strides in this area and I believe we will continue to do so. At SC Ports, three of our six senior management positions are held by women, including myself serving as COO.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p>We all must play a role to increase diversity in the supply chain, in part, by paying attention to who we hire, train and promote. I look forward to the day when I am on no longer on a panel being asked about how to advance women in our industry because it will no longer be top of mind.</p>\n<p><strong>How important is it to business that we keep driving diversity forward?</strong></p>\n<p>Ports are incredibly fast-paced environments where new challenges present themselves every day. It is imperative to have diversity across the board — regarding sex, race, age and culture — to strengthen organizations. Diversity creates space for different ways of thinking and new ideas. I believe in surrounding one’s self with team members who bring different perspectives, experiences and knowledge to the table.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you think we will see in the next 5-10 in supply chain?</strong></p>\n<p>Ports with excellent infrastructure and well-run terminals will continue to capture more cargo and grow above the market. Cargo owners want reliability and speed to market now more than ever. We have planned our infrastructure, operations and workforce to ensure the swift movement of cargo. We are prepared to efficiently handle our customers’ growing supply chain and capacity needs.</p>\n<p><strong>What advice do you have for young supply chain professionals? </strong><strong>How do we get the next generation excited about supply chain?</strong></p>\n<p>For those in school, it is important that supply chain jobs are discussed in the classroom and that relevant training is offered. This could mean a commercial driver’s license program for motor carriers, a six-month shadowing program for crane operators, which we offer, or the opportunity for mentorship that could lead to supply chain management degrees. SC Ports works with schools and community groups to teach students about port operations and career opportunities, which can spark a lifelong interest.</p>\n<p>For those already in the workforce, it is important to pursue additional training and educational opportunities. Be committed to excelling in your job, sharing ideas and being decisive.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s next for Barbara?</strong></p>\n<p>I plan to continue nurturing our excellent team and pursuing innovative solutions in the supply chain to ensure we remain the preferred U.S. container port.</p>\n<h2><strong>Meet Our Sponsor</strong></h2>\n<p>This Women In Supply Chain™ feature was made possible by our sponsor, Fastenal.

They share what they want you to know about crushing glass ceilings across the supply chain.</p>\n<p>Keep reading for smart career advice and deep insights into breaking into the chain.</p>\n<p>This month we’re proud to highlight <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/melissa-puchalla-19050a9/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Melissa Puchalla</a>, the director of supply chain compliance for <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/fastenal/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fastenal</a>. Melissa has almost two decades of experience in procurement and supply chain and was hailed on the <a href=\"http://www.assentcompliance.com/conflict-minerals/top-100/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2016 Top 100 Conflict Mineral Influence Leaders</a>—a distinguished list recognizing leaders for supply chain excellence.</p>\n<h2>How did your supply chain journey start?</h2>\n<p>I started in accounting at Fastenal 16 years ago—inspired by the founders and their support of local communities. I learned quickly that if you were up for the challenge and ready to do more, there were growth opportunities.  Learning about Fastenal’s operational footprint sparked my move to supply chain as a procurement specialist—changing my role from a just-a-job position to a career. It clicked.</p>\n<p>The procurement specialist role was challenging, but when the gears started turning, I realized how much I could impact operations. I explained that going onsite and picking, receiving, and dealing with disruptions at the distribution center supported improving service levels. Getting out from behind the computer screen and excel spreadsheets was a breakthrough. As a team, we aligned our work, goals, and purpose. Even now, I still bring my team to the sales and operations floor so they remember <em>why </em>we do what we do.</p>\n<p>That first role in supply chain started me on the path to where I am in my career now. From then on, I took on roles laser-focused on bringing more support to underdeveloped areas with a potential negative risk or service to the operations. We’ve grown our team from the ground up—creating and paying forward opportunities for growth throughout the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Europe, Asia—and soon—Brazil. As we grow we promote supply chain diversity, empower sustainable, planet-friendly approaches, and power a transparent, compliant global supply chain with social responsibility initiatives. All this progress happens while we develop team members and solutions to continue our <em>Growth Through Customer Service </em>mission<em>.</em></p>\n<h2>How do you face challenges head-on?</h2>\n<p>For my team, our greatest challenge is keeping up with sales and operations. Fastenal’s growth model relies on decentralized decision making; leveraging local and global supply chains. To ensure supply chain compliance, we have to keep pace with those arms of the business. That weakness can also be a strength—keeping our business agile and aligned.</p>\n<p>The COVID-19 pandemic we’re experiencing has been a challenge for everyone. We’ve done everything in our power to remove roadblocks, strengthen compliance protocols without unnecessary delays, and gain the ability to weather labeling regulation changes impacting every export into Mexico since October. From COVID-19 PPE to everyday supply chain demands, we are committed to serving every customer. And, as markets shift, changing tariffs impact business, supply chain strains evolve, and more disruption occurs, we have to change too.</p>\n<h2>Tell us about a standout career moment.</h2>\n<p>The highlight of my career is watching teams evolve through the collaboration and development we empower. I’ve grown with Fastenal. I didn’t travel growing up, I’m thankful for every experience. And I’m grateful for the ability to extend these opportunities to our team members—that’s beyond rewarding.</p>\n<p>I realize they can thrive from the energy of these trips—applying the same business practices in other countries and excelling for months to come. These experiences abroad show team members how their work impacts every customer—internal and external.</p>\n<h2>How did you find your voice in a male-dominated industry?</h2>\n<p>I stood out early on because I have always used my voice. I was raised by a strong, motivated woman. Now, I realize how much that helped me get to where I am in my career today. Early on at Fastenal, I understood the environment was driven by ideas, not tenure or titles. We were encouraged to share ideas—that’s where the fun started. I wanted to learn why my excess inventory aggravated a hub manager. I learned quite quickly when I had to go receive it in and help sell the surplus.</p>\n<p>That’s when I knew I had to focus on becoming a part of the solution instead of part of the problem. I’ve spent over a decade creating solutions that have improved IT systems, supported international teams, and paved the way for many roles that never existed before. I continue challenging others around me to use their voices so we don’t miss out on the next innovative idea to improve service levels.</p>\n<h2>What advice do you have for Women In Supply Chain™?</h2>\n<p>Dig deeper, collaborate, and rise up. I’ve felt the challenges of a male-dominated space, and it took years of growth and development to find my balance. I have three daughters who remind me daily of my <em>why. </em>They’re watching me lead, act as a team, stay committed, and strive for success in the supply chain every day.</p>\n<p>Also, don’t underestimate the power in connection. Connect with others and embrace a mentor who challenges you to be your best self. I am blessed with mentors, male and female, who have helped me on my path to where I am today. And I’ve learned the most from the ones who pushed me the hardest.</p>\n<p>I’d like to thank Donnalee Papenfuss, Fastenal vice president of contract development and support, and my power colleague and supply chain director, Wendy Suchla for the drive and impact they’ve both had.</p>\n<h2>How have you seen supply chain evolve, and what still needs to change?</h2>\n<p>The importance of quality data and the need for immediate solutions are the most significant changes. The “I-want-it-yesterday” mentality is real. The on-demand economy has made all companies step up their eCommerce and operations game to meet consumer demands and fulfill same-day orders.</p>\n<p>Fastenal’s footprint enables us to remain close to customers. That’s why we’re thriving with the opportunity to continue becoming more than just a supplier, but a supply chain solution for organizations. Regulations and supply chain demands are always changing; bringing supply chain transparency to the forefront. So, for compliance teams, we view mandates as openings to rise to the occasion and highlight areas where we strive for excellence.</p>\n<h2>So, what’s next?</h2>\n<p>It’s time to capitalize on the importance of supply chain risk mitigation and transparency as we continue to grow.  I look forward to being a larger part of our growth model and ensuring the same for our valued customers. These goals will develop opportunities for others in the years to come.</p>\n<h2><strong>Meet Our Sponsor</strong></h2>\n<p>This Women In Supply Chain™ feature was made possible by our sponsor, Fastenal.

I wanted to turn it into a full-time reality. Around the same time that I launched the blog, I launched my first website. I was tired of the service industry and ready for a fresh start.  My cousin worked at a 3PL where they were looking for an executive assistant. So, I figured, <em>why not? </em>I applied, got the job, and shortly thereafter, my immediate manager discovered my side hustle and asked, “<em>Why don’t you start handling our website and digital marketing?” </em> Now, more a decade later, I own <a href=\"https://digitaldispatch.io/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Digital Dispatch</a>, a logistics marketing agency.</p>\n<h2>What kept you coming back to Logistics?</h2>\n<p>My grandparents—part of the crew from Louisville, Kentucky who relocated to Jax, Florida— worked for CSX Railroads. So, growing up, I had a general idea of supply chain. But it wasn’t until I was looking for a fresh start as an executive assistant to the C-suite at a 3PL that I had a breakthrough. That role sparked a major interest in the process of how stuff gets from point A to point B. I loved that role, also, I always knew I wanted more.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the 3PL closed after five years. I decided to use my marketing skills in another direction and applied for a copy editor position at Void Magazine, a local media company. Within two months Void promoted me to Editor in Chief position—bringing more local exposure. With all that local visibility, I became a local sports radio personality and broadcaster.</p>\n<p>These broadcasts happened regularly, a few times a week. So, I went to work with my previous manager who started up HTS Logistics, another freight company. I joined HTS Logistics as their marketing director and worked with them for two years before my manager (and mentor) said, “<em>It’s time for me to push you out of the nest.”</em></p>\n<p>And that’s when I founded my organization. Three years later, it’s still the best decision I ever had to make. I can use my marketing and broadcast skills to help other companies reach their digital goals—daily.</p>\n<h2>Why did you start Freight School Playbook this year?</h2>\n<p>To save logistics companies time, shorten their sales cycles, and help differentiate them from their competition with on-demand digital marketing training. When COVID hit, the demand for IT and web solutions exploded overnight. Digital Dispatch was slammed for months.</p>\n<p>While I was able to support organizations with an ample digital budget, there were many I couldn’t help because the timing wasn’t right with current contracts already in place. But my 2020 plan including creating an educational component to my service offerings. This summer when those bigger jobs concluded and my time freed up a bit, it was time.</p>\n<p>Time to finally create the modern educational piece that’s A) been missing in this industry for a while and B) make it affordable for the small, growing businesses that need it the most. Most companies know their website and marketing are important aspects to attract customers, but many don’t have the resources to hire a marketing department or they simply don’t know where to start. Freight School Playbook helps them make smart, deliberate moves with modern digital strategies to help organizations across the chain capitalize on what makes them unique: their story.</p>\n<p>And we teach them how to tell that story through courses covering podcasting, content marketing, website auditing, content distribution, and more—all built with the logistics professional in mind.</p>\n<h2>Why is digital content marketing so important?</h2>\n<p>Your digital marketing is your initial handshake with a potential customer. Play it right, and your digital strategy can empower a continued connection to your customer base. That way you can not enhance and expand on your customer relationships.</p>\n<h2>Who is your career crush and why?</h2>\n<p>Sara Blakely, the SPANX founder is my professional idol. Sara worked full-time in door-to-door fax machine sales and had a breakthrough when her employer required her to wear pantyhose. Sara was upset. She hated that the seam showed while wearing open-toed shoes.</p>\n<p>She decided to ditch the awkward hosiery feet—cut them right off. That’s how SPANX was eventually born. Blakely attempted to sell the product to hosiery manufacturers all over the country but discovered all those companies were led by men who didn&#8217;t know the product they were selling to women. She used her life savings ($5k) to start the business, wrote the patent herself, and found a manufacturer who backed the idea because his three daughters were excited about it. Since founding SPANX, Sara is a billionaire recognized as one of the most powerful women in the world. And she’s launched a foundation to help women through education and entrepreneurial training. What’s not to love?</p>\n<h2>What hurdles have you overcome in your career?</h2>\n<p>My greatest challenge was the closing of the first logistics company I worked at—it was unexpected and hit right before the holidays.  At that point in my career, I was making great money, enjoyed a nice work-life balance, and was still able to expand my side-hustle dreams.</p>\n<p>I didn’t want to stop working for my managers or my goals. I didn’t want to rework my entire professional life. It was depressing. But a few months later, I scored that copywriter job at a magazine, became their Editor in Chief. That led to a career in broadcasting—all these skills were learned and earned because a company I worked at closed.</p>\n<h2>What trends have you seen for digital marketing in supply chain?</h2>\n<p>Digital media trends have been moving content in-house for a while, especially in other industries, but COVID has since fast-tracked that movement. Now the excuses of “I don’t have the equipment” or “I’m nervous to be on camera” are out the window. Everyone knows how to meet virtually, and probably has a decent microphone and webcam.</p>\n<p>There are zero excuses to avoid creating in-house content to reach your business goals. If time is a priority for your business like it is for mine, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/digital-dispatch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-schema-attribute=\"\">Digital Dispatch</a> can help with this entire process. Or you can learn how to do it yourself via our Freight School Playbook training.</p>\n<p>If you aren’t already creating content to help potential customers solve their problems, it’s time to start, like, yesterday. Because if you don’t, your competition will.</p>\n<h2><strong>Meet Our Sponsor</strong></h2>\n<p>This Women In Supply Chain™ feature was made possible by our sponsor, <a href=\"https://www.apexglobe.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-schema-attribute=\"\">Apex Logistics</a>.

With certifications from the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, she is currently studying to achieve her Level-5 CIPS diploma. Memory is a buyer for Compressor Aid Services—a SMME-based in Johannesburg South Africa.</p>\n<h2>How did your supply chain journey start?</h2>\n<p>My supply chain journey was accidental but well-seasoned. I started working for Compressor Aid Services in an administrative role as an office clerk. The more experience I gained with customers and addressing their concerns, the more I realized I had to put myself out of my comfort zone to learn the technical aspects of customer support. In my previous job, I was an elementary school teacher. So, this was like being thrown overboard. I had to learn quickly right in the deep waters.</p>\n<p>I got my hands wet learning compressors as an assistant working with the technicians and getting into the heavy work of stripping a unit and watching them rebuild the compressors to standard. I learned exactly where all the spares go and the function they serve. This experience proved priceless.  It also helped me learn to troubleshoot compressors with my ability to ask technicians about the why’s and how’s of fault solving practically.</p>\n<p>It’s tough because you have men watching you work, ready for you to fail. That&#8217;s the exact motivation I needed to prove them wrong. The knowledge I gained from watching the fitters and technicians service units is exactly what helped me to push unit sales and make our clients&#8217; experience with our service invaluable. Customers value consistency.</p>\n<h2>Did you have a mentor?</h2>\n<p>Yes, my progress within the industry can be attributed to the support and encouragement of both my male manager and colleagues, specifically our distributor manager and a special woman, Terry Compaan. Terry patiently helped me learn from her experience. She was always willing to lend a hand when I needed one. People can sense when you’re genuine—that makes them root for your success. And you know you aren’t alone.</p>\n<p>Just last year we managed to win the award for Gardner Denver African Distributor of the Year for 2019. There were only three women at the awards ceremony, out of a room filled with over forty men. It was validation that it isn’t just a man&#8217;s world. There’s enough room for more women in the manufacturing industry.</p>\n<h2>What and who inspires you?</h2>\n<p>I am fortunate enough to have an opportunity to drive the cause to pull down the social constructs in a male-dominated industry and take a stand—showing I’m just as capable of doing “a man’s job” as my male counterparts.</p>\n<p>And the who, whenever people ask me who am l, I tell them I am Chloe&#8217;s mum first. I’m inspired by her passion for life maybe because she is a six-year-old and lets nothing hold her down or dampen her spirits for too long. Her place in the world is ultimately defined by the example I set for her, and the path I pave for her as a little, young lady growing up in a world filled with disparities and patriarchal boundaries intended to limit the full potential of who she is meant to be.</p>\n<h2>How can other women stand out in a male-dominated industry?</h2>\n<p>You need a radar to keep innovating and being adaptable to industry shifts and changes both in your immediate and extended environments. Keep stock of how the environment is evolving and how you are contributing to changes. If you keep that on your radar, you won’t be caught off-guard. How we differentiate ourselves depends on how willing we are to question traditional processes, customs, and values to learn something completely new.</p>\n<h2>What keeps you motivated?</h2>\n<p>My <em>why </em>is simple. To leave the world better than how I found it. Someone helped me see the potential in my life, regardless of where I started. I hope I can pass that on and make things happen for someone else who needs it. That&#8217;s why I love supply chain because nothing about it is predictable or certain. No two days are alike. There is no room to stop growing or grow complacent. Like Eckhart Tolle said, &#8220;When you become comfortable with uncertainty, infinite possibilities open up in your life. Fear is no longer a dominant factor in what you do, and no longer prevents you from taking action to initiate change.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There’s no place with more potential than in a broad field like supply chain management.</p>\n<h2>What’s your vision for the role of diversity in the supply chain in the future?</h2>\n<p>We are not where we started, and the reach of how far we can go is infinite. The voices of the minority and previously marginalized continue being amplified because even those who wouldn&#8217;t boldly give us the platform can’t ignore the noise and difference we are contributing anymore. Even the most undermined in society are a source of innovation.</p>\n<p>We are only just tapping into the benefits of diversity and inclusion. There has been a lot of talk and gradually action will become more universal as other marginalized groups join the cause.</p>\n<h2>What’s next for you?</h2>\n<p>I&#8217;m excited about the future. It can only get better. I&#8217;m currently studying to get  CPIM certified and also studying for my advanced diploma in CIPS. I look forward to expanding my network of like-minded professionals. The future always has a curveball for me. That&#8217;s exactly what gets me excited.

At Let’s Talk Supply Chain, we believe we can only make progress when women empower each other. That’s why every month we’re proud to feature the bold women leaders who are changing the face of supply chain.</p>\n<p>Our Women In Supply Chain™ series introduces you to the female thought leaders who you need to know about now. We share their achievements and what brought them here, and what they want you to know about breaking through the glass ceilings in your career and across the supply chain.</p>\n<p>Read on for best practices and career advice to keep you powering through your workweek—inspired.</p>\n<p>This month, we’re proud to highlight <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sscudderprintmarketing/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sarah Scudder</a>, a marketing, procurement, and technology executive with almost two decades of experience. Sarah is the president at <a href=\"https://rsnetwork.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Real Sourcing Network</a>. She is known throughout the industry for her thought leadership and passion in bringing the supply chain to the boardroom.</p>\n<h2>How did your supply chain journey start?</h2>\n<p>Basically, on another planet with my love for design, creativity, and all things fashion. I dabbled in modeling and went to college to pursue a career in the industry. But my aspirations changed abruptly my senior year. I had just chaired a diabetes fundraising event and had hired Golden Pacific Systems (GPS)—a local outsourced print management firm—for sourcing and buying print and marketing materials.</p>\n<p>So, imagine my surprise when they offered me a job afterward. GPS was small then and was looking for new ideas—big ideas. Leadership was ready to grow nationally and hire up-and-comers with fresh perspectives and new approaches to accelerate their expansion. Despite knowing little to nothing about print, procurement, or marketing—needing a job—I accepted the offer.</p>\n<p>GPS provided a hands-on, entrepreneurial environment to quickly learn all the areas of running the business, including accounting, operations, leadership, technology, marketing, and sourcing. That’s how I discovered my purpose as a professional driven by my core passions, marketing, and sourcing. I built and managed a team of marketing services buyers.</p>\n<p>During my eight years at GPS, I learned to navigate the deep intricacies of sourcing print and marketing services and how to use marketing to rapidly expand a business. I supported GPS in tripling the organization in size.</p>\n<p>In 2013, GPS was acquired by The Sourcing Group (TSG), a print management firm. I agreed to stay on to serve as the company’s Chief Growth Officer. I joined Real Sourcing Network (RSN) August 2018 where I serve as the President and oversee growth, strategy, and marketing.</p>\n<h2>What was your breakthrough moment?</h2>\n<p>I studied the market in depth in my role as Chief Growth Officer. I learned that many marketers don’t believe in outsourcing print and some didn’t have a large enough spend to justify outsourcing. And then I quickly identified an emerging trend: companies that spend $1-5M in print and marketing services didn’t have a centralized solution, or a single source.</p>\n<p>I also discovered that procurement and marketing weren’t collaborating. Typically, marketing teams controlled the marketing budget and didn’t want to integrate procurement into the process.</p>\n<p>That’s when I had a breakthrough. Develop a print and marketing services sourcing tool geared towards procurement <em>and </em>marketing. Then stakeholders could agree on the solution together—collaboratively.</p>\n<p>The tool would make it easier to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Integrate with third-party systems since most companies already have ERP systems and/or sourcing solutions</li>\n<li>Guide buying for building a print RFQ</li>\n<li>Automate a competitive five-bid process for each job</li>\n<li>Capture local, sustainable, and diversity spend</li>\n<li>Track savings and data</li>\n<li>Allow companies to setup their own print suppliers</li>\n<li>Provide a built-in supplier base</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What has your greatest challenge been?</h2>\n<p>The biggest challenge facing the print and marketing services category is the lack of a supply chain’s control and influence on marketing spend. In 70–80% of organizations, marketing dominates that spend.</p>\n<p>Translation? Supply chain has little to no influence.</p>\n<p>But there’s a solution. When supply chain and marketing work together on sourcing processes and systems there’s plenty of time, money, and resources to save.</p>\n<p>My challenge was getting marketing and procurement leaders invested enough in their print spend to put a central solution in place. Many organizations use the same two print suppliers they have for decades. So, there is no competitive bidding, no diversity-spend awareness, and zero tracking or data. I was determined to shift mindsets to open the idea of managing spend differently.</p>\n<p>I actively educate professionals in the industry to overcome this mindset to seek more thoughtful collaboration and results. I am constantly leveraging social media, digital thought leadership initiatives, events, and other media outlets to accelerate momentum and visibility around this move forward.</p>\n<h2>What achievements are you most proud of?</h2>\n<p>First, building my team. I work with incredible people who are on a mission to help organizations better manage their print spend. Our success at RSN is due to their hard work, creativity, and innovation.</p>\n<p>Also, making the shift from traditional sales outreach to content-driven marketing. I learned that adding value by providing helpful information is a much stronger way to build a brand. Supply chain professionals don’t want to be sold. They want to learn. They are looking for new approaches to efficiency and driving change.</p>\n<p>And finally, implementing 15 RSN clients over two years. My team and I have built a solid pipeline of companies making a significant investment in print that are open to a technology-driven print category solution.</p>\n<h2>Tell us about your mentors along the way:</h2>\n<p>I owe everything to my parents for teaching me the importance of kindness, treating everyone with respect, and making the world a better place.</p>\n<p>I’ve been fortunate to have several mentors in other areas of my life: leadership, real estate, investing, procurement, marketing, and writing. I seek out outgoing, inquisitive innovators who learn from their experiences. It’s also important to me to learn from others outside of procurement. There’s so much knowledge out there to gain from eCommerce, retail, and technology trends.</p>\n<h2>How did you find your voice?</h2>\n<p>I’ve never been good at “fitting in,” I’m weird and quirky. I found my voice about two years ago when I accepted that not everyone is going to like or agree with me. I have trolls, and I’m O.K. with it.</p>\n<p>LinkedIn is my platform of choice for brand building. If the networking platform were a person, she’d be my best friend. (We spend a lot of quality time together!) I’ve actively invested in building my brand as a thought leader an subject matter expert in print and marketing procurement.</p>\n<p>I want to continue increasing awareness around the benefits of using technology to implement strategic print category solutions. So, we can bring together company leaders to see the value of procurement and marketing working in collaboration.</p>\n<h2>What skills do you need to stay relevant in supply chain?</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Be a great salesperson.</li>\n<li>Be passionate about change and disruption.</li>\n<li>Love research and data analysis.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What do you see for the future of supply chain?</h2>\n<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has made it clear that healthy supply chains are essential for healthy communities and global economies. Supply chain is no longer just about cutting costs and writing POs. Now, the supply chain plays a strategic, visionary, and creative role that is a critical part of a company’s (and our nation&#8217;s) success.</p>\n<p>Supply chain still doesn’t have a seat at the executive table in many organizations. However, with the right leadership in place, supply chain has the potential to emerge as a more visible and valued revenue-generating function.</p>\n<p>Getting there is a challenge. It’s also a great reason for ambitious people to pursue procurement over other more well-known careers. I have a bias towards marketing services procurement. It’s challenging, fun, and has maximum potential for making an impact.</p>\n<p>My hope for the future is that more organizations will hire supply chain professionals with interpersonal skills who can build relationships, sell, and drive change. These people skills are more valuable than technical sourcing skills. Technical skills can be learned.</p>\n<p>Companies need to implement more niche-category solutions (like our Sourceit tool for sourcing print and marketing services) versus using one general system to do everything. Niche-category solutions enable buyers to go deeper into a category with tools that solve specific needs. These solutions can work with broader systems to cut PO’s, manage AP, and track data.</p>\n<h2>What do you see for your future?</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Enjoying a dinner date with Bradley Cooper.</li>\n<li>Expanding my Ted Baker wardrobe.</li>\n<li>Becoming a better vegan cook (I almost burned my house down cooking tofu, so I’ve got a long way to go).</li>\n<li>Reading more books, (I’ve never liked reading or listening to books).</li>\n<li>Making more of an impact through daily acts of kindness.</li>\n<li>Being a better friend, daughter, and life partner to Paul.</li>\n<li>Honing my brand to gain global recognition as a print and marketing procurement thought leader.</li>\n<li>Building RSN to be the leading technology-driven print category solution.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Meet Our Sponsor</h2>\n<p>This Women In Supply Chain™ feature was made possible by our sponsor, <a href=\"https://www.apexglobe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Apex Logistics</a>.

Paola received the National Logistics Award in 2018—the highest recognition of Mexico’s logistics industry, awarded by the Ministry of Economy, Ministry of Communications and Transport, and other industry associations.</a></p>\n<p>She graduated business school with honors, attending Insituto of Tecnológico de Monterrey and Universidad de Valle de Mexico.</p>\n<h2>How did your supply chain journey start?</h2>\n<p>Accidentally. I was studying Administration to focus on marketing or media communications when I had the opportunity to work at CEMEX. The organization’s logistics area was gaining speed and structure, but women were still rare in operations positions.</p>\n<p>From an entry-level role as a logistics admin, I worked to become the first woman in leadership at CEMEX Mexico—developing four strategic management roles to support the organization’s growth.</p>\n<p>Since then I’ve built my career in Supply Chain across several industries at multi-national organizations like APL Logistics, Driscoll&#8217;s, L´ORÉAL, and DANNON Group. From Purchasing to manufacturing, demand planning, warehousing, transportation, inventory management, and customer service—I’ve redefined and developed different roles at every point of the supply chain.</p>\n<h2>Why do supply chain leaders have to be risk-takers?</h2>\n<p>Change is inevitable in modern supply chain management, and risk management is mission-critical to success no matter what you do. Risks evolve and become more prevalent with time. Traditional risk management approaches aren’t as effective in the fast-changing supply chain landscape. Risks exist in land, air, and ocean. They’re inevitable and unavoidable.</p>\n<p>Ironically, the biggest risk you can take is not taking any. In an evolving industry that’s constantly changing and responding to outside disruptions, the only strategy that is guaranteed to fail is being overly cautious. Because it’s only when you take risks that you can achieve something really remarkable.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve always been competitive, challenging myself to achieve more. Making bigger wins means taking bigger risks. Managing complex operations when women weren’t accepted in the industry was the first of many risks I’d take in my career. I moved from warehouse management to transportation management—leading high-performance teams—every step of the way. I take risks to balance my professional life with my personal goals as a wife and mother of three and an Ironman athlete.</p>\n<p>I work and live the fail-fast mentality, knowing that taking risks is a win-win, every time. How? If you have a positive outcome you’ve won, but even if the outcome is less than ideal, you’ve amassed more knowledge and learned for the future.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, you are more likely to regret the risks you didn’t take and the things you didn’t do, than the ones you did. Even challenges and obstacles eventually translate into efficiencies and increased transparency to build trust and consistency.</p>\n<h2>What personal mantras help you power through the constant shifts in supply chain?</h2>\n<p>C<strong>hoose progress over perfection—every day. </strong>Women breaking into male-dominated industries feel like we need to prove ourselves. We want to be perfect and we don’t want to fail ourselves. But if you don’t put yourself out there and try you can’t move forward.</p>\n<p>Perfectionism can be paralyzing anytime you try something new. The first time you take a giant leap of faith and it works it’s an incredible boost to your confidence. That empowerment gives you the confidence to go do it again.</p>\n<p><strong>Build community—no matter what you do</strong>—and it’s is crucial to keep in mind when evaluating, strategizing, and taking risks. I’ve found myself in two communities—one with my peers who are passionate about supply chain—the other a community built around the importance of a healthy lifestyle.</p>\n<p><strong>Surround yourself with like-minded individuals and don’t be afraid to ask for help. </strong>Don’t get stuck in your head, be ready to ask others for support, and see every challenge as an opportunity to learn more.</p>\n<p>That starts with your personal life. I have a supportive partner with the same interests who works in the same industry. My husband encourages me to be the best version of myself every day.</p>\n<h2>What skillsets should up-and-comers develop to break into supply chain?</h2>\n<p>Supply chain professionals must maintain a confluence of skills in these areas to keep up with industry changes and face everyday challenges:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Data and analytics </strong>are a must for guiding business intelligence—an area in high demand. Being ready to extract, process, and analyze data can help you make fast gains that get noticed.</li>\n<li><strong>Technology advancements </strong>are constant. Making data-driven decisions and automating more processes demands supply chain professionals who know how to harness new capabilities to innovate and effectuate change in supply chain operations and business processes.</li>\n<li><strong>Domain knowledge—</strong>understanding the roles of logistics, transportation, forecasting, warehousing, distribution, production, quality, and risk within fulfillment processes is key to building your foundations for a launchpad.</li>\n<li><strong>Enterprise Systems </strong>are deeply tied to business operations and decisions. Understand how they work and the information shared between the systems.</li>\n<li><strong>Leadership </strong>skills are a must, even if you aren’t in management. Be ready to collaborate with a diverse set of stakeholders, to solve problems and cultivate thought leadership to meet the next big moment in supply chain. Being a team player and having those soft skills is the most important, managers can train for processes, not attitude.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The bottom line is that supply chain professionals cannot keep relying on the same traditional skillsets. We must move forward and take a bold, quantum leap into the future to define and shape the future of the digital supply chain.</p>\n<h2>Who inspires you?</h2>\n<p>My family. My husband, my daughters, and son are my engine to get up every day and give the best I can in everything I do. They motivate me to become a “better me” every day because I want to empower them the same way. I am driven by helping others forward—my family, friends, teams—helping them break through their unique boundaries.</p>\n<p>Endurance is also a big motivator for me (in Ironman, marathons, golf tournaments, etc.). I love finding new boundaries and those breakthrough moments when you discover you’re stronger than you thought. Pushing my physical limits and taking risks teaches me to be comfortable being uncomfortable—in all areas of life.</p>\n<p>And I’m inspired by the next big challenge. For me, the greatest part of working in supply chain is that every day is different from the next. The value I’m bringing energizes me to get up and tackle the next day. I am always learning something new—supply chain is so dynamic—it’s hard to get bored.</p>\n<h2>What do you want women to know about working in supply chain?</h2>\n<p>A tradition of a male-dominated supply chain sector has made it difficult for women to be well represented, or at least considered, as competitive equals for supply chain jobs. In the past few years, there have been subtle signs of change, but not enough.</p>\n<p>The supply chain is full of opportunities and can be a rewarding path forward for women in their careers. Be resilient. You can manifest your desires and make them real. No matter how positive you are, there are going to be challenges. Embracing them rather than just bracing for impact makes a difference.</p>\n<p>Having a growth mindset and thriving in disruption means you are constantly finding more opportunities to learn and grow. Embracing challenges even during the best times will make you more strategic and resilient. Because supply chain is all about embracing change with resilience.</p>\n<h2>What do supply chain organizations need to do to build resilience and stay relevant?</h2>\n<p>Hire more women. The supply chain needs to look for more ways to attract women to roles that are more traditional operations positions. Our industry needs more advanced “soft skills,” beyond subject matter expertise. Women are uniquely positioned to bring these skills to your organization.</p>\n<p>Organizations should be looking at:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Equal pay for women in the industry.</li>\n<li>Bringing in more diverse and inclusive talent within the younger generations through university programs and visits to campuses and schools promoting visibility for logistics and supply chain organizations and why they matter.</li>\n<li>Strong female leadership and success stories to inspire, motivate, and propel the next generation of Women In Supply Chain™ forward with strong mentors and role models.</li>\n<li>More women in leadership positions.</li>\n<li>Identify and develop high-performing women who aspire to lead.</li>\n<li>Provide the kind of individual feedback that reinforces and builds confidence and outcomes.</li>\n<li>Build empowered and effective networks with the express role of generating leadership opportunities for women.</li>\n<li>Implement challenging and aspirational career paths for women at work.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What’s your next goalpost or challenge?</h2>\n<p>I am currently a supply chain consultant and actively participate as a speaker for national and international educational events, conferences, and webinars. My articles on supply chain regularly appear on industry publications and I just started my blog.</p>\n<p>I see my long-term future right here in the supply chain arena as an industry expert supporting others in pursuing their ideas and building out a strategy. I’ve had amazing mentors and managers and I’d like to provide similar guidance, maybe taking on a leadership role at a global organization where I can be a supply chain ambassador.</p>\n<p>I want to continue reaching further through industry events and conferences as a motivational speaker and coach to support the next generations—they are the future of supply chain.</p>\n<p>And, of course, I want to keep writing, researching, sharing, and learning from the supply chain community. That goal never stops.</p>\n<h2><strong>Meet Our Sponsor</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This Women In Supply Chain™ feature was made possible by our sponsor, </span><a href=\"https://www.apexglobe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apex Logistics</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span><b><i>Apex Logistics International Inc is deep rooted in diversity and culture, led by our own “Woman In Supply Chain” CEO, Elsie Qian; these values are why we partnered with Let’s Talk Supply Chain for the Women In Supply Chain™ series.  Apex is recognized as one of the fastest growing Top 25 airfreight forwarders in the world, with a network of over 2500 global employees in more than 70 countries.</i></b></p>\n<h3><strong>About The Author:</strong></h3>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-2891 alignleft\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/index-240x300.png\" alt=\"Naomi Garnice\" width=\"101\" height=\"117\" title=\"\">Naomi Garnice is the Director of Marketing for <a title=\"MicroAge\" href=\"https://microage.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://microage.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1579626018296000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEQIUcfmpLb2AdR2zbPRVza9CjlrQ\">MicroAge</a> where she leads the marketing team and creative strategy.

That’s why each month we’re proud to highlight female trailblazers who are fiercely changing the face of supply chain.</p>\n<p>We introduce you to the thought leaders you need to know now, share their stories, their achievements, and what they want you to know about shattering gender barriers everywhere in supply chain. Read on for career advice, and the inspiration you’re needing right now.</p>\n<p>This month, we’re proud to highlight <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/joselina-peralta-47091412/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Joselina Peralta</a>. Joselina has over two decades of industry experience and is the vice president of global supply chain &amp; procurement operations at <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/troy-corporation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Troy Corporation.</a></p>\n<p>She earned her master&#8217;s and bachelor&#8217;s degrees from Pontificia Universidad Catolica Madre y Maestra PCUMM and she completed Leadership Studies at Columbia University.</p>\n<h2>Where did you get your roots in supply chain?</h2>\n<p>My roots started at home with strong role models in leadership: my Dad an Airforce General and my Mom—ahead of her times—a hospitality industry executive. It can’t be overstated—my parents are my heroes. At our dinner table, they always encouraged us to ask questions, think-outside-the-box without limitations, and to challenge the status quo. Meeting the moment and resistance with replies like <em>what if, what about, let’s play it out</em>, going deeper and looking and asking for more.</p>\n<p>Early on I learned how to evaluate and factor differences in viewpoints. Navigating limiting beliefs and understanding when there was no room for buts. Challenges can drive creative thinking, problem-solving, collaboration, and negotiation skills. And I learned early on the value of how you treat your team and business partners—clients and suppliers—like family.</p>\n<p>There are no mistakes. Life and work give us experiences and opportunities to learn and grow. To “walk the talk” you need to be accountable and open to constantly improving. I was blessed to be raised by phenomenal role models who instilled core values that have shaped my career.</p>\n<p>After achieving my bachelor’s and master&#8217;s degrees in Economics, I was ready to make deals, that’s when I discovered my passion for procurement and all things supply chain. I get to work on my passion every day.</p>\n<h2>How have your mentors along the way influenced your leadership style?</h2>\n<p>My mentors saw my potential and actively invested in my professional development—believing in me and opening doors and opportunities. These professionals and their generosity play a huge part in who I am as a leader. I believe in investing in people, developing talent, and empowering the next generation. I believe in paying-it-forward—unleashing potential in others is in large part of my mission at work.</p>\n<p>My first mentor gave me the best career advice—teaching me the importance of active listening. “There’s a reason why we have two ears one mouth,” she said. “Do the math.” And I will never forget that.</p>\n<h2>What’s different about supply chain now than when you started?</h2>\n<p>It’s constantly evolving—challenging you to combine human qualities, deepen partnerships, orchestrate market dynamics (social, geo, political, weather, and disruptions) with people, processes, and systems.</p>\n<p>When it comes to your internal forces, more than ever, now it’s about versatility, adaptability, and integration at the speed of information. You need to synthesize valuable insights to execute timely decisions with precision and accuracy. Leveraging the building blocks of value chain and blockchain can help you achieve supply chain resiliency while understanding the compromises and tradeoffs with internal and external impacts. That means aligning your value proposition to gain market share and create more opportunities that ultimately translate into efficiencies and increased transparency to build trust and consistency.</p>\n<h2>What values have fueled your success and results for those around you?</h2>\n<p><strong>Always put people first</strong>—not only is this a core value of mine—it’s part of my life’s purpose. Developing talent, coaching, and mentoring is incredibly rewarding. Because when you invest in people you reap the benefits tenfold.</p>\n<p><strong>Be authentic. </strong>Staying true to who you are while having a genuine interest in connecting with others and learning about them is critical to establishing trust and rapport. It shows them that you’re open to other points of view without judgment. Bringing your true self to work promotes lasting relationships on every level—with your team, clients, business partners, and shareholders.</p>\n<p><strong>Be versatile. </strong>Our world is always changing. It’s pivotal to find value and opportunities in every situation every day—even your toughest challenges. This growth mindset keeps me sharp without being limited by attachments to single concepts. Instead, I embrace information in a way that’s as multi-dimensional and multi-disciplinary with broad-sweeping insights to empower collaboration and positive outcomes.</p>\n<p><strong>Be brave. </strong>Have the courage to speak up; to be first; to be different; to take risks. Keep launching forward while also knowing and understanding when to take a step back to master the latest lessons learned.</p>\n<h2>Why is gratitude so important to you professionally?</h2>\n<p>I am a true believer in sharing positive feedback and expressing emotions authentically and in real-time. There’s no standard approach to giving thanks. From saying <em>thank you</em> to showing it with a gift, a card, or a letter. Gratitude channels positive vibrations that make a lasting impact. As Maya Angelou said, “people will never forget how you made them feel.”</p>\n<h2>What other words do you live by?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>“There are no limitations to what we can do or achieve together.”</li>\n<li>“Life is a journey, not a destination. Let’s make it count.”</li>\n<li>“Life is too short, don’t sweat the small stuff.”</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>As a Latina woman in supply chain, what do you want the community to know about diversity and inclusion?</h2>\n<p>Everyone brings something unique and valuable to the table—whether that’s points of view, experiences, ideas, beliefs, or insights. No one is an island. Embracing diversity is about acceptance, inclusion without prejudice, expanding our perspectives to understand a universal truth: there is a big, broad world with space for everyone to thrive, learn and collaborate from each other—together.</p>\n<p>Growth and evolution are rooted through incorporating diversity with different schools of thought and by constantly challenging the status quo.</p>\n<h2>What’s your favorite part of supply chain?</h2>\n<p>Cultivating collaborative relationships—at all levels—and finding solutions that ignite innovation and enable supply reliability and customer loyalty.</p>\n<h2>What’s your next goalpost or challenge?</h2>\n<p>There are so many. I want to continue expanding collaboration with like-minded professionals, innovative organizations, and business partners. I’m constantly trying to challenge the status quo to level up entrepreneurial mindsets, quality standards, value generation, and supply chain transparency. Post-COVID-19, there are going to be ample opportunities to cross-collaborate across industry sectors—globally.</p>\n<p>I’m also looking to work with forward-thinking organizations that empower inclusion and embrace bold, creative leaders to help them propel their organizational mission and channel success through culture, technology, financial and operational excellence.</p>\n<h2><strong>Meet Our Sponsor</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This Women In Supply Chain™ feature was made possible by our sponsor, </span><a href=\"https://www.apexglobe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apex Logistics</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span><b><i>Apex Logistics International Inc is deep rooted in diversity and culture, led by our own “Woman In Supply Chain” CEO, Elsie Qian; these values are why we partnered with Let’s Talk Supply Chain for the Women In Supply Chain™ series.  Apex is recognized as one of the fastest growing Top 25 airfreight forwarders in the world, with a network of over 2500 global employees in more than 70 countries.</i></b></p>\n<h3><strong>About The Author:</strong></h3>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-2891 alignleft\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/index-240x300.png\" alt=\"Naomi Garnice\" width=\"101\" height=\"117\" title=\"\">Naomi Garnice is the Director of Marketing for <a title=\"MicroAge\" href=\"https://microage.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://microage.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1579626018296000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEQIUcfmpLb2AdR2zbPRVza9CjlrQ\">MicroAge</a> where she leads the marketing team and creative strategy.

At Let’s Talk Supply Chain, we know the power in promoting the female trailblazers who are making bold moves to push our industry forward.

That was the first time I learned the important role the chain plays in international trade and what customers need from a logistics company—their deepest pain points and challenges. After a couple of years, I joined a world-leading freight forwarder. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started from the bottom and served in different positions—from operations to customer service, to customs clearance and then gateway management. Working my way up in different areas I built a comprehensive understanding of the industry while gaining some serious professional savvy along the way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later on, I had an opportunity to support Apex China in expanding their network into the United States. In 2003, we launched the first US-based station in Los Angeles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apex Americas started as a small team of just two employees, myself included. Over the past 18 years, working with my team we’ve leveraged our unique strengths between Asia and the United States. We’re maintaining steady growth in our global network, product, infrastructure, customer portfolio, and team building. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m proud that today Apex has proven itself as one of the top freight forwarders anywhere in the world. </span></p>\n<h2><strong>What challenge sparked a breakthrough moment for you?</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I first launched Apex in the U.S., we had zero name recognition—we were nobody. Apex was a newcomer without a presentable customer of reference in our portfolio. These obvious gaps made it difficult to promote ourselves in the market. We had a very small team. Everyone handled A-to-Z with a fiercely DIY approach. Only a few customers wanted to try Apex—most viewed us as a risk as a new and nimble market player.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I still remember how I brought on my first customer. Her organization was producing promotional products and was laser-focused on transit times. She mentioned that she was using the direct flight service from Shanghai to Los Angeles, but due to the noon arrival time, she couldn’t get cargo out of the terminal to make her 3 p.m. shipping deadline—adding more time to delivery to customers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She told me if she could find any smarter alternatives with Apex that she would give us a try. I checked all available flights in that timeframe and eventually found a solution—utilizing the United Airlines passenger service from Shanghai to San Francisco and overnight trucking to Los Angeles. With the same cut-off time at origin, her cargo would arrive promptly the next morning for its connection, not at noon. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We presented the cargo flow details with a timeline and she decided to give us a try. To fulfill the service, we needed to ensure the cargo wouldn’t miss the overnight trucking from San Francisco to Los Angeles. Every night we followed up with the airlines until we knew the cargo was loaded on the truck. Our customer was thrilled with the outcome and our service. She started referring us to her colleagues and we started building our reputation in the industry. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sidenote, now, over a decade later, she is still doing business with us today. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This challenge empowered my team to rise to the occasion—we knew that if our product and services can support our clients in meeting their goals and deadlines, we could win their trust and loyalty for meaningful, rewarding, and longterm relationships. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, when you face a challenge, force yourself to think outside-of-the-box and transform that challenge into an opportunity.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>What challenges have you faced as a woman leader in logistics?</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We all know that the logistics industry is more traditional and male-dominated. Fact: most of the leaders in logistics are men. So, many of my clients are surprised when they meet me—a female leader at a logistics organization—and the smart ones are also impressed. They know immediately that I’m different and that makes Apex different.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our diversity has fueled the kind of curiosity that opens doors, making prospects more interested in learning who Apex is and what we have to offer. Like every challenge, I see my gender as more of an opening to new opportunities than a barrier or an obstacle.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Who inspires you and why? </strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jeff Bezos. The way he runs Amazon inspired me, that drive to keep finding smarter and faster ways to reach customers is exactly what we have at Apex.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most important element he showed me is the obsession with customers. In every Amazon board meeting, there’s always an empty seat symbolically reserved for their customers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And, in every industry, especially the service industry, we must listen to what our customers need instead of giving them what we think they want. Only a thorough understanding of your customers and a deep gratitude for them can empower superior products and services.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Back to Bezos and Amazon, when a company first starts, the team is often united and creative around fresh goals and hunger for growth. But once the company’s scale exceeds several thousand people, it starts becoming more siloed, looser, and more conservative.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have all experienced the pressures of the early days of entrepreneurship, mixed with confusion and the desire to grow the company—bigger, faster, smarter. Bezos calls it “Day-1 spirit”. Everyone wants to see their organization peak, but peaking also means a turning point to a possible fall backward. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintain Day-1&#8217;s original spirit and intention and keep yourself at the starting point to sustain constant momentum and unlimited potential. Entrepreneurship is the driving force for continuous company growth. Don’t underestimate its power.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m inspired about being creative and putting strategies into action. To become the benchmark company in the industry, you must think differently, think bigger, think outside of the box—every day. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is there something your competitors never do? What are their values? Can you do that? How will you do that—differently?</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Apex we ask these questions every single day. It’s our mantra, part of our genes, and the foundation for our sustainable growth. </span></p>\n<h2><strong>What do you want the next generation of female supply chain leaders to know?</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be Confident. As women, we possess unique advantages. We have a better ability to withstand stress and we have more tenacity. We are indomitable, detailed, and persistent. These traits all help us succeed and crush barriers and business norms.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And of course, be passionate. Passion is the key to success. Find what you love to do, what makes you hungry, and be passionate about that. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everybody has downtime. But as a leader and a role model, you need to be self-motivated and empower your team. </span></p>\n<h2><strong>What fears or uncertainties have you had to face on the job?</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The logistics industry is full of surprises. We see cargo delays, missing and sometimes damaged products, and usually, these scenarios are completely out of our control. When the unexpected happens, you need to know how to triage the situation—have a contingency plan, and communicate with your clients proactively. </span></p>\n<h2><strong>What have you learned from leading men as a woman in a male-dominated industry?</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve learned that as long as you show your respect and trust, there’s no difference in leading men or women. </span></p>\n<h2><strong>What do you see for the future of logistics?</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Logistics is becoming a technology industry. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How can we integrate the flow of cargo with the flow of data? How do we give real-time visibility internally and externally?</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The answer is technology—that’s why Apex invests hugely in IT development and digital transformation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a data-driven organization, we understand our customers’ needs through a balance of personal customer service and measured trends, enabling us to execute at a higher level than our competitors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our goal is to continue to be leaders in the digital forefront, from both a systems standpoint as well as marketing and client visibility.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>How are you leading Apex through the COVID-19 pandemic and into the new normal?</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fortunately, at Apex our organization hasn’t been severely impacted. While a significant portion of our clients are in retail, and we all saw the dramatic impact there, we’ve had dramatic growth in other sectors like personal protective equipment (PPE) and medical supplies. With such volatile market conditions where capacity cannot be guaranteed, our year-round charter program presents a unique solution. A large amount of new business we’ve gained since the pandemic started has come from our existing clients.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, we realized the growing importance of diversity in both emerging markets and expanded product offerings. Apex had started this expansion a few years ago. Now, we have 41 branch offices throughout Mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, United States, Canada, Mexico, Netherland, Germany, Belgium, Australia, and New Zealand. Recently, we opened our new office in Xi&#8217;an and our first office in Japan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now we offer a one-stop supply chain solution, including air and ocean freight, 3PL and warehouse management, customs clearance, Free Trade Zone, surface transportation, E-Commerce, trade consulting, and temperature-controlled Shipping. These capabilities position Apex and our customers for the new normal and the future that lies on the other side of it. </span></p>\n<h2><strong>Meet Our Sponsor</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This Women In Supply Chain™ feature was made possible by our sponsor, </span><a href=\"https://www.apexglobe.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apex Logistics</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span><b><i>Apex Logistics International Inc is deep rooted in diversity and culture, led by our own “Woman In Supply Chain” CEO, Elsie Qian; these values are why we partnered with Let’s Talk Supply Chain for the Women In Supply Chain™ series.  Apex is recognized as one of the fastest growing Top 25 airfreight forwarders in the world, with a network of over 2500 global employees in more than 70 countries.</i></b></p>\n<h3><strong>About The Author:</strong></h3>\n<p>Naomi Garnice is the Director of Marketing for <a title=\"MicroAge\" href=\"https://microage.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://microage.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1579626018296000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEQIUcfmpLb2AdR2zbPRVza9CjlrQ\">MicroAge</a> where she leads the marketing team and creative strategy.

Every month we’re proud to feature woman leaders who are boldly changing the face of supply chain—highlighting thought leaders, sharing their stories, achievements, and advice for others coming up the ranks.</p>\n<p>And this month, we’re proud to feature <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sydney-badger/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sydney Badger</a> in our Women In Supply Chain™ blog series. Sydney is the co-founder for <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/public-habit/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Public Habit</a>, an organization committing to cutting the waste out of the fashion supply chain.</p>\n<p>She has over a decade of experience in fashion, product marketing, and learning what fuels consumers—and supply chains. Sydney has a bachelor&#8217;s degree in International Relations and Chinese from Brown University and a bachelor&#8217;s degree in Advanced Chinese from Capital Normal University.</p>\n<h2>What started your supply chain journey?</h2>\n<p>I grew up in England and was great at languages—leading me to study Mandarin in the United States. Junior year, I studied abroad in Beijing and landed my first internship working for a UK-based apparel company—working in quality control and production management from Qingdao, China.</p>\n<p>That internship sparked a life-long curiosity and interest in China and the rapid business development I’ve witnessed first-hand since 2008. I moved to Shanghai after college, but I didn’t get back into retail and supply chain operations until I was stateside again—trying to stay connected to global trade and China specifically.</p>\n<p>Ralph Lauren brought me onto the Asia-Pacific merchandising team–a function I didn’t know a thing about–that’s where I learned retail and fashion—from the ground up. From there, I was recruited to Amazon’s retail team, and my world was opened up even more to the scale of a global supply chain and to the possibilities of enabling global trade.</p>\n<p>In 2018, I left corporate to start <a href=\"https://www.publichabit.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Public Habit</a> with my co-founder, Zakhar. And we made it our mission to disrupt the global fashion supply chain to provide more value for consumers and suppliers while minimizing waste in the system.</p>\n<h2>What did you learn about yourself along the way?</h2>\n<p>I learned that I appreciate efficiency and that the beauty of an open-market organization—like Amazon—resonates with me. Marketplaces facilitate global commerce and can create value for organizations and consumers who wouldn’t typically have access and visibility to broad customer bases or selections, respectively.</p>\n<p>I learned that everyone, no matter where they are from, their background, or who they work for, has something to teach me.</p>\n<h2>What challenges made you who you are today?</h2>\n<p>Building a company, period. It’s very challenging and once you’ve solved one challenge, it’s onto the next. For instance, developing long-term relationships with suppliers who still have a transactional mindset. We look at our suppliers as our production team.</p>\n<p>We are sales and marketing, and that level of trust and collaboration takes equal investments of time and work. Out of around 200 suppliers that we vetted to join us on Public Habit, just three met our requirements today because of MOQs, flexibility, and the willingness to work in a new way. But we only need three to start.</p>\n<h2>What does good mentorship look like to you?</h2>\n<p>Having a co-founder has made the journey to building Public Habit much more enjoyable, rewarding, and, just easier. I never had a mentor or advisor before this partnership.</p>\n<p>Good mentors–like my co-founder and I–are willing to have tough conversations with you. That allows you to surface uncomfortable truths or feelings that you may not have otherwise articulated and helps work through them.</p>\n<p>They effectively empower you to solve problems yourself because, however much we, as founders, may doubt ourselves at times, typically we know what to do. Everyone sometimes needs  a nudge and boost to pull the trigger.</p>\n<h2>What do you want readers to know about sustainability and supply chain?</h2>\n<p>I am heartened by how much of a driving factor sustainability is becoming for consumers. They are demanding information and brands are responding. That will trickle down through the supply chain at some point, but there is still a long way to go.</p>\n<p>There’s still a lot we can do differently in the fashion industry. The fundamental challenge in most supply chains is how complex and opaque they are—making sustainability and transparency a challenging pursuit.</p>\n<p>In fashion, a single t-shirt typically touches at least 12 different hands before reaching the consumer. Most retail brands don’t know much beyond their finished goods suppliers.</p>\n<p>A marketplace like Etsy does a much better job than a typical brand like The Gap in connecting customers and manufacturers directly. You know what you’re getting, the origin, and the person behind the product.</p>\n<p>That’s the first step towards accountability that just doesn’t exist in most fashion supply chains today.</p>\n<h2>What aspect of the retail supply chain made sustainability a core part of your personal and professional mission?</h2>\n<p>No one is benefiting from the current system, it just stopped making sense to me. Suppliers, brands, customers, and the environment deserve more. I couldn’t rationalize why brands were planning their orders 12-18 months ahead of time, marking up their products immensely to manage the storage, logistics, markdowns, and liquidations.</p>\n<p>I’m excited about flipping the supply chain dichotomy to a demand-driven model that listens to customers first and produces on-demand to minimize waste, eliminate unnecessary markups, and create more value for everyone.</p>\n<h2>What else inspires you?</h2>\n<p>Travel. I have been fortunate to travel extensively in my life and career. I always wanted a career that would scratch my itch for travel, provide exposure to new cultures and people, and opportunities to solve hard problems.</p>\n<p>My opportunity—and responsibility—at Public Habit is to do just that. I meet people, go out in the world and learn from others, asking questions, and solving problems. It’s pretty cool, tiring, but cool.</p>\n<h2>What’s next?</h2>\n<p>Well, I’m almost five months pregnant with my first kid, plus, we’re in the middle of a global pandemic and a pretty unstable global situation. So, excessive travel isn’t in my immediate future.</p>\n<p>But I’m excited about taking this time to leapfrog our efforts to build Public Habit into an industry-changing company. Now is the time for a new kind of business model that is more sustainable and efficient that creates more value—across the chain. That’s exciting enough for me.</p>\n<p>Meet Our Sponsor</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-2743 alignleft\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/logo-shipz-1.jpg\" alt=\"Shipz logistics simplified\" width=\"110\" height=\"110\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/logo-shipz-1.jpg 200w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/logo-shipz-1-100x100.jpg 100w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/logo-shipz-1-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 110px) 100vw, 110px\" />This Women In Supply Chain™ feature was made possible by our sponsor, <a href=\"https://shipz.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Shipz</a>. The middle layer of companies that import and export want to work with forwarders, but are limited by the current process. Meanwhile, forwarders are equally strained by the amount of “free” work they do, and by being treated as a bank—they would be happy to focus on what they do best—moving freight. There is a growing disconnect, that could be devastating to the industry if left unaddressed.</p>\n<p>Shipz is a neutral bid-and-shipping platform for mid-market shippers, providing forwarders with a safe space to stay in the ring. Forwarders benefit from direct access to shippers and instant bookings.

Vidya is the chief operating officer, founder, and an early investor at </span><a href=\"https://www.optessa.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Optessa Inc.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The software organization provides edge technologies for production planning and scheduling—delivering complete solutions for execution in manufacturing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vidya has overseen Optessa’s finance, administration, and human resources since the organization’s inception. She has a master’s degree from the University of Edinburgh and a Ph.D. from the University of Poona.</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h4><strong> What brought you into supply chain?</strong></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was drawn in by the opportunity to contribute at Optessa in a long-term meaningful way—to constantly grow, adapt, and learn. I am not a sequencing or scheduling expert, I don’t work on developing Optessa’s technology.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, I knew the organization was facing unique operational challenges—from navigating difficulties in development to meeting organizational needs working with the business founders. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We constantly evolve and tackle challenges in a variety of areas, and it makes the process interesting—there are always new opportunities to grow and learn. </span></p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<h4><strong>Take us through your career journey:</strong></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Optessa is very much a realization of our founder’s (my husband’s) vision of providing quality planning and scheduling solutions that meet industry needs. Srinivas (Vasu) Netrakanti shared his view of the challenge and opportunity with Optessa’s current CEO, Dr. Ashok Erramilli. Ashok, Srinivas, and I formed the company together—the journey started there. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We called the company Netaps at first, then the name changed to Optessa in 2006. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Srinivas led the company as the chief executive officer until August 2017, Ashok was the CTO, and I oversaw finance, HR, and administration. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We built teams in Edmonton, New Jersey, and in India. We survived the deep recession of 2008, and then in 2013, Optessa was growing and thriving again.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sadly, we lost Srinivas (Vasu) to Kidney Cancer that summer in 2017. The Optessa team and founders, Ashok and I, renewed our commitment to realizing Vasu’s vision for Optessa at that very difficult moment in time.  We reorganized ourselves to meet the new challenges and have continued forward on a path of growth</span></p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<h4><strong> What challenges have you overcome and what did you learn from them?</strong></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a founder of a small business, you are constantly balancing so many obligations—to customers, employees, investors—often on limited time and resources. I have learned you have to continually strive for excellence. At Optessa, the quality of our software solutions has empowered us to establish our brand and build resilient, lasting business relationships. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve learned to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">do my homework </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">so I can advocate on Optessa’s behalf—to be professional and also, persistent. Learning how to adapt in a crisis has been a challenge I’ve faced with my team on more than one occasion. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Small businesses sometimes feel the impact more aggressively in volatile markets and environments. I’ve learned you have to be dynamic, constantly advancing your business environment—it’s all about remaining nimble, poised, and ready to quickly respond to emerging challenges—whether the 2008 recession or the current COVID-19 healthcare pandemic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an organization, Optessa’s team finds the challenge of solving planning, sequencing, and scheduling issues for manufacturing intellectually invigorating. We aim to maintain a friendly, open work culture based on teamwork and mutual respect.</span></p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong> What advice do you have for other leaders and up-and-comers in supply chain</strong>?</span></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Invest in people. Be resilient, it takes optimism and staying nimble to adapt. And, never stop your pursuit of excellence.</span></p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>\n<h4><strong> What do you want newcomers to supply chain to know?</strong></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have confidence in your abilities, but don’t hesitate to ask for help. Know that preparation and hard work are always important—do your homework. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outside of the office, take care of your personal financial management. And, if you are just starting out, keep business and personal finances separate. Remember to take personal time out to pursue other passions outside of work. </span></p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>\n<h4><strong>What has made you so successful in supply chain and life?</strong></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am always ready for what’s next—ready to learn and adapt.</span></p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>\n<h4><strong>What is next for you?</strong></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making sure Optessa comes out of this pandemic strong—not just surviving—thriving. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meet Our Sponsor</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This Women In Supply Chain™ feature was made possible by our sponsor, Optessa</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span>Optessa&#8217;s <strong>Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS)</strong> software creates complete, optimal, even quality solutions.

Christina is a senior manager in industry and solutions marketing at <a href=\"http://www.kinaxis.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kinaxis</a>, a supply chain technology organization supporting businesses in increasing ROI and revenue while mitigating risk. She has almost two decades in marketing and supply chain experience—including brands like SAP and JDA, now Blue Yonder. Christina has a Bachelors in both Strategic Communications and Psychology.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What brought you into marketing for supply chain?</strong></span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Almost a decade of experience at one of the largest ERP software giants groomed me for my foray into supply chain marketing. As I grew in my professional career, I was also building a life—marriage, babies, all the milestones I curated in support of my personal goals. Then there came a point when I needed to pause and spend more time honoring that life.</p>\n<p>So, I made the decision to break away from my career for a year. I stayed home with our first daughter while leading marketing for a local nonprofit for homeless youth, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/hope-4-youth/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hope 4 Youth</a>, a philanthropic undertaking I’d always envisioned.</p>\n<p>It didn’t take long to realize I could achieve both my professional and personal ambitions. I also missed corporate life and gained a sharpened perspective while away. What I‘d been doing in my career was emphatically transforming lives—everywhere.</p>\n<p>The break-through innovations in technology delivered around the globe also serves a higher purpose, and I wanted back in on the action. Then the opportunity to work for a supply chain-focused software company knocked on my door, and that foray has turned into a lasting and fulfilling career in supply chain marketing.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What makes product marketing for supply chain technology important?</strong></span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Our customers face challenging, complex, and sometimes chaotic issues. As a supply chain marketer, you must intrinsically understand their problems—sometimes even before they do—and articulate a clear and differentiated solution. You don’t want decision-makers paralyzed by concerns. Instead, with the right technology in place, we empower supply chain leaders to quickly adjust to real-world supply and demand drivers and make fast, informed decisions for people, planet and profitability.</p>\n<p>I strive to be a trusted and informed resource, bringing relevant and timely messaging to customers to position their organizations as leaders in their respective fields and the industry at large. Product, industry, solution, and services marketing contextualizes technology in a way that resonates with the customer and their journey to success. That success is at the heart of the storyline, and the purpose for everything I do.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What are some challenges you’ve faced in your career?</strong></span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>I’ve been fortunate to grow with employers that always supported advancement, diversity, and most importantly, work-life balance. I’ve operated successfully in a remote work environment (in theory) with the built-in flexibility to maintain a healthy life outside of “work.”</p>\n<p>The biggest challenges were self-imposed—when I didn’t grant myself that same grace and felt I needed to constantly prove my worth by never saying “no.” Finding time to make sure I was succeeding in all my passions (work and home) was a challenge, especially since my husband also keeps demanding hours and spends a lot of time on the road.</p>\n<p>What makes it possible is our mutual respect for one another’s goals, aspirations and in equal measure we balance out a busy but rewarding life for our entire family.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>How does success as a woman in supply chain look to you?</strong></span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Success is not typecasting yourself or giving way to a self-fulfilling prophecy caused by how you think others perceive you by your sex, gender, age or appearance. Success is knowing you deserve that seat at the table and owning it. I am fortunate that the culture at Kinaxis in one that empowers and elevates women, making this success even more achievable.</p>\n<p>I view a woman breaking through in supply chain as talented and confident with a relentless ambition to ascend, no matter who’s in the room.</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What advice do you have for breaking into supply chain marketing?</strong></span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Be mindful of all the things around you that are impacted by supply chain—you’ll easily find that almost everything you touch, wear or consume is made available to you because of the software that mobilizes supply and demand planning.</p>\n<p>It never sounds cool to answer, “what do you do?” with “supply chain marketing.” But, the minute you explain what your organization does to help make the world run, especially in times of crisis, the relevancy sinks in and the interest is immediate.</p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>How has disruption in supply chain changed your strategy as a marketer?</strong></span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Like supply chain solutions, I must be proactive and agile. Continuing unpredictability and disruption, via economic or social swings, regulatory changes, natural disasters, or viral outbreaks like the current Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic demands more agility.</p>\n<p>Speed is mandatory for companies that rely on manufacturers to react fast with global visibility to operate proactively. That means focusing on staying current on what’s happening in the world around us as marketers and serving as that trusted, educated resource for our customers.</p>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>We just celebrated International Women’s Day—is there a woman leader who inspires you?</strong></span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>One of the women leaders I’ve looked up to my entire career started as a peer of mine. I still covet her as one of my best friends. She always pushed me, made me see my value, and challenged me far beyond my comfort zone at an early age.</p>\n<p>When we were two young females in a predominately male industry, she rapidly ascended because she made no excuses. She always exuded confidence and empathetically encouraged me to do the same.</p>\n<ol start=\"9\">\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>What does your future look like?</strong></span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>With the disruption we are currently seeing with COVID-19, advancements in supply chain are making it possible to keep critical medications and staples of our daily lives available—which also means restoring hope and confidence to communities and business leaders around the world. In times like these, the importance of supply chain becomes real and deeply visible—our industry saves lives.</p>\n<p>Because of this I see my long-term future right here in the supply chain space. My hope is that my future, and the future of this planet, is benefited by the power to more proactively respond to and navigate through inevitable volatility. I am optimistic this is very possible with smart planning, monitoring, and response tactics in place.</p>\n<p>I will continue working hard to empower customers to transform their businesses far beyond what they think is possible. I have a passion for the professional services side of the business, because it combines my love for people and process. I will keep driving organizations to leverage these resources for a sound strategy upfront and follow through with strong change management to maximize software utilization (and make their employees happy).

    "content": "<p>This month we’re proud to feature <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/cathy-morrow-roberson-lti/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Cathy Morrow Roberson</a> in our <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/women-in-supply-chain/wisc-blog/\">Women In Supply Chain™</a> blog series. Cathy is the founder and president at <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/logistics-trends-&amp;-insights/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Logistics Trends &amp; Insights LLC</a>, a global logistics market research company that provides industry insights, research content and consulting. She has over two decades in marketing and supply chain experience plus Cathy has an MLS from the University of South Carolina and bachelor’s in history and economics from Winthrop University</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">What brought you into supply chain?</span></strong></p>\n<p>Like a lot of folks, I kind of stumbled into it. I was working at a consulting startup that was teetering. Luckily, UPS was a customer and offered me a position in a brand-new product and services group, developing fresh offerings outside of small parcel offerings. It was UPS, so of course I jumped.</p>\n<p>We worked on all kinds of new ideas and concepts—some ahead of their time like online grocery delivery. We also built out the UPS reverse logistics service offerings. The concept that eventually became UPS Capital was first developed in our group which eventually evolved into UPS Supply Chain Solutions.</p>\n<p>I stayed with UPS for 11 years doing competitive and market analysis, M&amp;A due diligence assistance, supporting business development, and more.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Tell us about your journey:</span></strong></p>\n<p>The original plan was to become an archaeologist, but my parents reminded me that requires teaching and public speaking which absolutely terrified me. So, I crossed that off my list, as well as my second choice, Economic Historian which also requires speaking to groups of people. I settled on becoming a librarian after receiving degrees in history and economics followed by a master’s in library science. Eventually, I added an MBA just to prove to myself I could.</p>\n<p>If you haven’t picked up on it yet, I love research. Can’t find an answer to something just let me know. I leave no stone unturned, and that’s continued throughout my career. From researching and analyzing new market opportunities, the competitive landscape, and more while at UPS. That trend has continued through today with my own business, <a href=\"https://logisticstrendsandinsights.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Logistics Trends &amp; Insights LLC</a>, a market research firm focused on supply chain.</p>\n<p>After 11 years with UPS, I moved on to a consulting firm within the supply chain space writing several off-the shelf research reports on particular parts of the supply chain sold to investment firms, logistics providers, shippers and so on. Eventually, I decided to start my business.</p>\n<p>Along the way, I discovered that I actually have a voice, sometimes perhaps a bit too loud or opinionated. I also found that writing isn’t so bad. I’ve really enjoyed writing for various publications, including a weekly column for <a href=\"https://aircargoworld.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Air Cargo World</a> and a monthly article for <a href=\"https://theloadstar.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Loadstar</a>.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">What’s a moment that’s stayed with you throughout your career?</span></strong></p>\n<p>The first time I walked into a warehouse, I knew right then and there that I belonged in logistics. It was like a library—everything neatly stored throughout the warehouse. The employees knew where everything was.</p>\n<p>And, of course, starting my own business. I’ve always wanted my own business, but I kept making excuses not to do it. My family members and close friends finally talked me into doing it, and I’m so glad they did.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">What are the biggest challenges in supply chain?</span></strong></p>\n<p>We’re still trying to reduce costs, improve efficiencies, speed up the last mile, provide visibility across the entire supply chain, reduce risks, etc. Those will always be challenges. But this year the big challenges are sustainability, (addressing climate change), and encouraging folks to be a part of the supply chain market.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/\">Let’s Talk Supply Chain</a> does a great job promoting the supply chain across your platforms. More folks need to do this—keep talking it up, work with local schools and universities.</p>\n<p>Same with sustainability—it’s not a marketing spin job, it’s a necessity. We need to keep talking about it, encouraging and applauding companies that make the needed changes, and highlight companies that introduce solutions.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">What do you want for the future of supply chain?</span></strong></p>\n<p>Simplicity. Supply chains are so complicated. We’re heading in the right direction with all this technology, but it needs to be easy and exactly what shippers need to move goods from point A to B as seamlessly as possible with visibility throughout the process. And, the same for warehousing. Sometimes we forget the KISS (keep it simple, stupid) process.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">What’s next?</span></strong></p>\n<p>I want to keep writing, researching, sharing, and learning from the supply chain community. Of course, I’d be lying if I said growing my business wasn’t part of my goals. And to that point, I am finally publishing quarterly supply chain reports available for purchase this year.</p>\n<p>I’ve also just launched a free M&amp;A database on my website that ties into a subscription-based portal with more analysis on supply chain topics. It’s all in the early stages, but I’m super excited! Who knows, maybe I’ll even take a real vacation this year.</p>\n<p>Meet Our Sponsor</p>\n<p>This Women In Supply Chain™ feature was made possible by our sponsor, <a href=\"https://www.sarahcaroline.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sarah Caroline</a>.

Kleo is the Chief Commercial &amp; Corporate Affairs Officer at Ashcroft Terminal, a member of the PSA Group.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">What made you passionate about pursuing a career in supply chain?</span></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The business of supply chain is really a part of every industry, every company, and, should be part of every role in a company. Supply chain is about understanding what it takes to move goods where they need to go in the most efficient way possible. It’s about being aware of what it takes to build a house, supply a restaurant, or move a train. All of us are impacted by the business of supply chain.  We live in an incredible country where too few of us pay any attention to the critical importance of Canada’s supply chain.</p>\n<p>Canadians as citizens of a resource-rich nation have an obligation to be curious about the intricacies of getting our natural resources to market as well as reducing costs to import the products Canada needs.  Moreover,  understanding supply chain opportunities provides a gateway for imports into North America, offering a wide range of Canadian companies a market of 400 million people with which to do business.  Supply chains are key to a company’s success.</p>\n<p>I was raised by an entrepreneur father and a marine biologist mother. So, being curious about our country, our province, and our world in general was instilled at a very early age.  This curiosity has helped my family and our company embrace the courage to develop  business opportunities that push us as a disruptor in the Western Canadian supply chain.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">What’s different about being a leader at a family business?</span></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>I joined the company my Dad started in 2004 after four years in the investment business.  People make assumptions that because one is a family member they have been handed opportunities.  My Dad has been my boss, my mentor and my friend for 42 years.  Certainly, he has given me opportunities, however; having the opportunity only gets one in the front door.</p>\n<p>My experience in family business is that you must work harder, constantly think strategically, and continually prove yourself, perhaps even more than if I wasn’t family.</p>\n<p>I’m proud of being a part of a driven, hard-working family.  Let’s just say Christmas dinner is never dull.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">How do you manage generational differences?</span></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>As a businessperson, learning from previous generations and their challenges is the greatest gift available.  I’m not interested in making the same mistake twice.  Embracing and learning from failures is how you grow and do better next time.</p>\n<p>Being able to work alongside my Dad every day for the last 16 years has been one of the greatest learning experiences of my life.  Lessons are cherished and respected.  Our team is always open to new ideas and latest ways of thinking.  We are learning from the past—incorporating open thinking is rarer than it should be in family businesses.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">What challenges have you faced as a woman in supply chain?</span></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>That’s not a question that I like, but I get it a lot.  I’m a person in business, being a woman shouldn’t matter.  However, the reality is that, at times, it does.  If you want to be successful in any business as a woman the fundamentals are the same—be smart, work hard, be professional, grow thick skin, and don’t cry in the boardroom.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">What’s your approach to tackling challenges and taking risks?</span></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>I have challenges, every day.  As my Dad says, &#8216;business is just about solving problems&#8217;.</p>\n<p>And, calling a spade a spade can be risky.  But, I believe that in business as in life, you must be honest and call out the BS when you see it.  Sometimes that hasn’t been well received, but so be it.</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">What’s your advice for women breaking into supply chain?</span></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Go for it!  Dive in.  Be curious.  Knowledge is power so, when you think you know the answer, keep thinking and challenging yourself by looking at every angle.</p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">What’s next?</span></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>There isn’t enough room in this blog to answer that. Let’s just say I’m very excited about the future and the opportunities around us.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">About The Author</span></strong></p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-1751 alignleft\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/index-240x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"132\" height=\"165\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/index-240x300.png 240w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/index-600x750.png 600w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/index.png 690w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 132px) 100vw, 132px\" />Naomi Garnice is the Director of Marketing for <a title=\"MicroAge\" href=\"https://microage.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://microage.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1579626018296000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEQIUcfmpLb2AdR2zbPRVza9CjlrQ\">MicroAge</a> where she leads the marketing team and creative strategy.

Charlotte is the Content Creation Manager Procurement Citizenship COE: Global Communication Lead for a Fortune 500 company. She is a keynote speaker and a member of the Institute for Supply Management’s (ISM) Thought Leadership Council. Charlotte has a decade of experience in supply chain. She’s been recognized over recent years as the <a href=\"http://30under30.thomasnet.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Rising Supply Chain Star</a> and hailed as a <a href=\"https://business.thomasnet.com/meet-the-30-under-30-class-of-2016?utm_source=30Under30&amp;utm_medium=Site&amp;utm_campaign=30Under302016&amp;utm_content=winners_page&amp;_ga=2.124042890.1074250344.1573761052-488645301.1573761052\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">30 Under 30 Rising Supply Chain Star</a>.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">What makes your supply chain journey global?</span></strong></span></p>\n<p>I have worked in five industries and three continents with the ability to experience supply chain from a global point of view. Supply chain is still an untouched territory of the future developments. Everyone is talking about blockchain, digital technologies, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), humanoid robots and autonomous intelligent systems.</p>\n<p>There is a great future in the field of supply chain management and how we will interact with the new technologies and innovations ahead of us. I strongly believe IoT (Internet of Things) will drastically change the future of supply chain. Gartner predicts, that by 2020 more than half of major business processes will incorporate some form of IoT. This is going to take the supply chain industry to a whole new level.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;\">How can women show up for themselves and their female counterparts in supply chain?</span></strong></p>\n<p>Be patient—trust in yourself. You cannot climb a mountain with your hands in your pockets. Surround yourself with positive people. Never give up, remember that it’s O.K. to fail. Stay authentic with open communication, especially with other women.</p>\n<p>Part of leadership is giving back to build a team that believes what you believe. Nurture each other. Support each other through recognition and reward—saying if the job has been done well. Educate yourself and your team—success is achieved through passion and on-the-job learning with your team.</p>\n<p>And be proactive, continue sharpening the “saw” to continue enthusiasm.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;\">What advice do you have for someone looking for a career change?</span></strong></p>\n<p>My advice is focus on passion and proactiveness. Two main factors that are helpful is being passionate about your work and what you do and being proactive and ambitious in solving problems. This helps to learn how to combat difficult challenges. It’s important to reach out to all stakeholders involved to solicit information rather than just waiting or it.</p>\n<p>Continuing to learn and adapt to new technologies is also very important. We live in a world where we cannot only study a topic and assume that knowledge will be enough for the next twenty years. It’s important to constantly want to learn more. You can have a real impact in the lives of others. And businesses can create a global impact.</p>\n<p>Become an early adopter, recognize new trends and be open to the latest technologies that can play an important role in the future.</p>\n<p>And surround yourself with people who push you to do more and be better. Keep setting your goals higher and higher. Good times and positive energy bring out the absolute best in everyone.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;\">What challenges have you faced as a woman in supply chain?</span></strong></p>\n<p>I agree with <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3969584/a-holistic-approach-to-advancing-women-in-leadership\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Gartner’s stance</a>. While gender representation for entry-level and middle-management roles is relatively balanced, the precipitous drop in women at senior-leadership levels cannot be attributed to any one single event. Organizational strategies to improve the proportion of women in leadership should thus reflect the numerous obstacles that hinder women’s career progression toward leadership roles.</p>\n<p>HR and D&amp;I leaders can improve the recruitment, selection, retention and promotion of women in leadership. They can do so by identifying where organization values and offerings diverge from female leaders’ preferences and expectations. They should also be auditing talent life cycle processes, including promotion and succession, to assess inclusiveness and potential bias.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">What steps can we take to increase diversity in the supply chain?</span></strong></span></p>\n<p>Firstly, set up women employee groups to promote diversity awareness within the enterprise. This will create a perception of an inclusive culture.</p>\n<p>Secondly, set up diversity trainings, mentoring programs and networking opportunities during or outside of work hours. For example, the Global Mentoring Program for High- Potential Women (Unilever).</p>\n<p>Unilever leverages a combination of formal programs to prepare high-potential female leaders for the next level of their careers. In addition to an accelerated IDP program and a formal HIPO program, Unilever established a Global Mentoring Program that matches each high-potential female leader with one of Unilever’s top senior leaders. The program aims to foster successful mentoring relationships and focus on individual development goals to increase process transparency, accelerate female leaders’ development and drive gender diversity at senior levels of the organization.</p>\n<p>Rather than relying on mentors to define the scope of their role with mentees, Unilever sets expectations through a global launch event and two mentoring training webinars. To ensure successful mentoring sessions, Unilever provides mentors and mentees with sample activities—including goal setting, mentor guidance and mentee reflection—that help them make the most of their time together. These activities are designed to help mentors and mentees build rapport, establish trust and engage in successful development planning.</p>\n<p>Thirdly make sure the hiring committee includes women. It’s critical to have a comprehensive strategy to better attract, retain and promote women.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">What’s next?</span></strong></span></p>\n<p>I want to be a supply chain ambassador by becoming an inspirational leader, speaker and coach for the younger generations. Since I am also a public speaker, I would like to guide and set an example for future generations.</p>\n<p>I reference that by 2050, 60% of global professions won’t exist anymore and will be replaced by new ones. Looking to the future, I see myself growing in the supply chain industry. I would like to stay in corporate and grow into a director or VP role. I will also expand in the field of keynote and public speaking for supply chain.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; color: #000000;\">Meet Our Sponsor &#8211; <a href=\"https://hulftinc.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">HULFT</span></a><br />\n</span></strong></p>\n<p>This Women In Supply Chain™ feature was made possible by our sponsor, HULFT.

Jill is a supply chain veteran with three decades of experience in Logistics.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>How did your supply chain journey start?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I made the decision I was not going to college when I graduated high school.  At 17 years old I saw myself getting married at some point in my life and being a stay-at-home mom.  One of my best friend’s moms was an office manager at St Johnsbury Trucking, she hired me as a receptionist.</p>\n<p>I liked the fast-paced environment that logistics work brings—I figured that out early.  It’s always different and you are always learning. I had a huge desire to do good work and help customers.</p>\n<p>While at the trucking company, I had many positions and worked for Tony Devlin the national account representative for our largest customers in my last role there.  My job was supporting his customers and making sure they were getting their freight picked up and delivered at the right time.  When there were problems, I had to fix them. PMC Logistics (Now a called Aborn &amp; Co.) was one of my customers.</p>\n<p>I had done every job at the trucking company and I couldn’t really grow much further unless I moved out of state.  Tony suggested I talk to Russ Aborn, the owner of PMC Logistics. I did and he hired me on the spot.  I’ll be forever grateful to Tony who saw an opportunity for me to grow at a company that values their people and doing great work for their clients.</p>\n<p>In 1993 I started at Aborn &amp; Co., working with customers and internally with operations to ensure clients were getting the best level of service.  In 2017, Russ gave me the amazing opportunity to run the company as the President.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>What has your experience been as a woman president in supply chain?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Honestly, it’s been a blast. I am truly one of the lucky ones—I love the work we do at Aborn &amp; Co. I always have. Twenty-six years ago, our founder, Russ Aborn took a chance on me, and I’ve never looked back.   It’s so gratifying to help clients stand up a best practice as it relates to working with their carrier providers. I care deeply about our clients and making sure we are providing the best service possible.</p>\n<p>There have been sacrifices.  Being a working mom, I’ve sacrificed time with my kids.  But there is value in this too.  My kids have been raised by a mom who works hard, has a ton of grit and is passionate about doing good work.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>What challenges have you faced as a woman in logistics?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I’ve been asked this question many times and it always trips me up.  I choose not to let something like a small-minded person hold me back because I am a woman and they may not like it.   I’ve never have had the attitude that being a woman was holding me back or going to cause me challenges.  There have been times in my career where someone may have been inappropriate or not valued a woman in business. But I just don’t care.</p>\n<p>I don’t let that negativity control my life.  Maybe it’s growing up with three brothers.  They never treated me any different than they treated each other.  And for sure, Russ who always has and continues to empower and mentor me doesn’t see me any differently because I am a woman.  I’m not blind to the fact that bias exists in the industry.  I just keep the mindset that it will not impact me in a negative way. I will continue to work hard, be authentic and live my best life.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>What advice to you have for the next generation of Women In Supply Chain™?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It’s up to us to empower each other. If we see that type of small-minded behavior, then we need to speak up and create change.</p>\n<p>Be humble, be genuine and be curious.  There is so much to learn in this industry.  It’s continuously evolving and changing.   Have a passion for the work you do, and you will soar.  There are so many different layers to supply chain. Find your niche and go for it.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Tell us about the biggest moment in your career:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The highlight of my career literally just happened on October 10<sup>th</sup>, 2019.   I’ve had this idea in my head for years that I wanted to get a group of supply chain professionals together to talk about the industry, challenges and collaborate on solutions.  I was tired of going to networking events or conferences and not really being able to genuinely collaborate with folks.</p>\n<p>In these environments, even on LinkedIn, if I talk to someone who has a freight spend, they think at some point I might try to sell them.  And with carriers the reverse was true, they wanted to sell their service to me. I wanted to create an environment where none of that existed and people would be willing to openly share.</p>\n<p>This month we had our first TransTech2020 meeting.  Carriers, NVOCCs, Shippers from all industries and consultants all got together to discuss the industry.  It was a total blast and so much was shared and learned.  I cannot wait for the next one.  To celebrate we are going to do it again!</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>What fears have you faced over your career?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Self-doubt has always been a struggle for me. I always thought I wasn’t good enough, smart enough, and uneducated without having gone to college.  That’s all head trash.  I am a constant purser of self-development.</p>\n<p>I have a hunger for always improving myself.  Self-development is a daily practice for me. I continually strive to be the best version of me.</p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>What advice do you have for logistics leaders on self-development?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Self-Care. Get enough rest.  Eat healthy.  Exercise.  Own and protect your time. We are all so busy.  You must take care of yourself to be and do your best.</p>\n<p>Work as hard as you can with people, data and technology to manage your supply chain the right way.  That takes a ton of mental energy which is why selfcare is so important.</p>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li>What’s next on your supply chain journey?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As a business it’s growth.  We are developing new business, new data science and new technology. It’s all so exciting.  We are a 31-year-old company that feels like a startup.  It’s a unique position to be in and so very exciting.</p>\n<p>Personally, I hope to continue to be the best version of me.  That means spreading love over my family and spending as much time with them as possible. To me, that’s what matters most.  Love, faith, family and doing really, really great work that helps others and inspires me.</p>\n<p><strong>Meet our Sponsor</strong></p>\n<p>This Women In Supply Chain™ feature was made possible by our sponsor, HULFT.

That’s why every month we highlight a woman leader in the industry on our blog. We share the stories, achievements, and advice for other women coming up the ranks in supply chain.</p>\n<p>This month we’re proud to feature Tanya Bischoff in our Women In Supply Chain™ blog series. Tanya is a director of supply chain in Canada for North. She has over a decade of experience in supply chain.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">1. How did your supply chain journey start? </span></strong>I was about to graduate with a Political Science degree and an emphasis in International relations. That summer, I had a job at McDonald&#8217;s head office in London, Ontario as an admin. I sat next to a department that was always on the phone negotiating with the government to import chicken into Canada.<br />\nOne day I walked over and asked what exactly they did—they were the purchasing department. I had never ever heard of supply chain as a profession. I started asking more questions and learned about SCMA and signed up my final semester of university. I felt graduating and starting a designation would help me land a job quicker.<br />\nI was right—I was immediately hired at Healthcare Materials Management Services in London as a purchasing analyst. Government and purchasing all rolled up into one career. How did I get so lucky?!<br />\nI continued to work toward my designation and took a job in Stratford Ontario at an automotive company buying steel and forgings. As soon as I finished my designation, I was hired by Blackberry to manage a $480 million portfolio.<br />\nThen I heard about Thalmic Labs, a startup with a YouTube video of a MYO (gesture control armband) on the internet. I contacted them and told them they should hire me to support supply chain creation to build the MYO. They did! I have been with the business now called North for the last six years. In that time, we built the MYO and then pivoted to make the world&#8217;s first fashionable smart glasses, FOCALS. It&#8217;s a brand-new product category.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">2. What has your journey to success meant to you? </span></strong>It has meant everything to me. I was the first person in my family to go to University. I am a really driven person. I&#8217;m not afraid to grind it out and work hard. That’s always served me well.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">3. What are the challenges you’ve faced along the way? </span></strong>I&#8217;ve spent the last decade in consumer electronics which is very challenging from a supply chain perspective. Predicting customers wants and needs is difficult. I&#8217;ve been through the highs of barely keeping up to demand and the deep lows of excess inventory; un-buying and difficult liability negotiations.<br />\nI&#8217;ve always been open and honest with my supply chain. I&#8217;ve built solid relationships. When times were good, I was good to my suppliers. When times were bad, I&#8217;ve asked my suppliers to be good to me. I still believe in the power of relationships, that’s important with suppliers. Nothing is completely transactional—the human factor is everything.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">4. Did you have a mentor to help you face those challenges, and what makes a good mentor? </span></strong>Formal mentor relationships sometimes feel forced. I like mentorships to grow organically. My mentors have been people I’ve observed in their roles. I&#8217;ve watched great leaders challenge their people, but also trust them.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve watched amazing negotiators who can command a room. I&#8217;ve seen people who are great at reading body language. These are all important skills in supply chain. Master these, observe, listen and use them. I&#8217;ve also learned a lot from bad leadership and poor negotiations.</p>\n<p>My advice is knowledge is everywhere if you are open to receiving it. If you sit around waiting for a formal mentor, then you can miss some important teachings that are all around you. Heck, I&#8217;ve even become a better negotiator because of my children. Especially from my toddlers. Toddlers are never afraid to ask for what they want, they will ask a million why questions and they don&#8217;t take no for an answer.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">5. How can we drive diversity in the supply chain? </span></strong>Most of the industries I&#8217;ve worked in have been male dominated. We need to do a better job of ensuring students are aware of the career possibilities of supply chain. I speak at high schools to share this knowledge and teach at Conestoga College to inspire others to consider supply chain as an option. My students are diverse and bring an interesting international perspective to the role.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">6. What is the toughest call you’ve made in your career? </span></strong>The hardest decision I’ve made was when the business asked me to reduce the size of my team. Everyone on my team was an allstar—they worked hard and worked well as a team. It was an agonizing decision to cut the team in half, none of the layoffs were performance-based.</p>\n<p>In the end, the team pulled together and everyone who was let go found great jobs immediately. That&#8217;s the cool thing about supply chain. We build a network with each other, passing along job opportunities, sharing knowledge and helping out, again relationships are everything.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">7. What do you love about working at North? </span></strong>I&#8217;m happiest when I’m adding value and being challenged. I&#8217;ve spent the last 5 years working in a startup. Startup life isn&#8217;t for everyone—it&#8217;s chaotic, things change on a dime, and nothing is ever certain. I thrive in this kind of environment.<br />\nI love the power to make decisions and change things that aren&#8217;t working very quickly. I work with some of the brightest minds and they keep me challenged and excited for work every day. In my personal life, I like to slow things down. I&#8217;m happiest up north at our cottage with my husband and our kids.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">8. What’s next? </span></strong>My plan is to have no plan. To keep doing what I love and see where that takes me. I&#8217;m open to all the possibilities.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 24pt;\">Meet our Sponsor</span></strong></p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-2133 size-thumbnail\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/r9FK4KJu_400x400-150x150.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/r9FK4KJu_400x400-150x150.png 150w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/r9FK4KJu_400x400-300x300.png 300w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/r9FK4KJu_400x400-100x100.png 100w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/r9FK4KJu_400x400.png 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" />This Women In Supply Chain™ feature was made possible by our sponsor, HULFT.

World hunger is still a world-wide epidemic. These numbers are shocking, devastating and undeniable.

If you agree, keep reading because there’s signs that we’re ripe for a sea change—supply chain professionals and retailers can end world hunger forever. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exciting right? Now before you go bananas let’s look at how brands—namely Kroger—are setting the example with real ways we can start closing the hunger gap now.</span></p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1936 alignleft\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image2-214x300.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"214\" height=\"300\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image2-214x300.jpeg 214w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image2-600x840.jpeg 600w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image2-731x1024.jpeg 731w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image2-768x1075.jpeg 768w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image2.jpeg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 214px) 100vw, 214px\" /><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ugly fruit is beautiful.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">About 10% of </span><a href=\"https://www.grocerydive.com/news/grocery--how-retailers-can-reduce-food-waste/535237/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">food on grocery shelves</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> goes wasted and oftentimes that includes reject produce. The double-headed tomato or I-didn’t-know-they-came-in-that-shape carrots.

The project is part of Kroger’s Zero Hunger | Zero Waste initiative with the ambitious goal of reducing waste across the company by 2025.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And Kroger isn’t the only grocery brand to get these flawed but healthy fruits and veggies back in the mix either.

Daria is a business development manager in the Netherlands for <a href=\"https://www.cargosnap.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CargoSnap</a>. She is a supply chain veteran with over two decades of experience in Logistics.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">How did your supply chain journey start?</span></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>As the daughter and granddaughter of merchant navy captains, my journey started early—sailing the Russian North with my father as a child on board a vessel carrying timber or supplies to smaller villages. It left an everlasting imprint on my memories of childhood and my life.</p>\n<p>Since I was old enough, every summer I worked in shipping and forwarding companies—learning about cargo manifests, bills of lading, stowage plans and so forth. After my studies, the going into shipping was the obvious choice. What I didn’t realize is how little people who aren’t involved in shipping know about shipping.</p>\n<p>I was always surprised at the reaction of others when I would answer where I work. “Ooh, you work for a cruise company”, or, “ooh, you send parcels”. When you aren’t in this amazing, crazy world of movement of cargo, you simply can’t comprehend the level of complexity.</p>\n<p>That’s why I try to make that journey more visible. Everybody talks about supply chain visibility, and I think as a company at CargoSnap we’ve made significant strides in making that happen.</p>\n<p>So, that&#8217;s when I took every single booklet of every single major my university offered. I flipped through every page and happened upon logistics and supply chain. I interviewed some of the seniors and figured it might be a subject I could enjoy. It was a big decision to actually sign up and go to the classes.</p>\n<p>And I told myself that there was no going back, taking full responsibility for my decision. Fortunately, the more I learned, the more exciting it became. It felt so at home—I made the right decision.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">2. What makes the supply chain journey remarkable?</span></strong></p>\n<p>Almost everything around us is from somewhere else. For example farm produce. That had to be picked up by truck; maybe bagged; inspected; reloaded onto a pallet; secured; stored at a warehouse; then loaded into a container or a ship. All before being transported across the vast seas to some other ports, where it would be discharged; inspected; reloaded; stored elsewhere; then probably reloaded again on a truck to a distribution center.</p>\n<p>It is a huge, complicated journey for everything around us that I’ve always found fascinating.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">3. What challenges have moved you forward in your career?</span></strong></p>\n<p>The main obstacle—it hasn’t always been easy to be taken seriously in the beginning—a woman in shipping starting out at a very young age. I have seen it all. This male-dominated business has only shown its ugly face to me a few times. But shake it off and move on and become stronger.</p>\n<p>And because reputation is all that matters, as you grow and work hard and honest, trust is built wherever necessary.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">4. Speaking of those challenges, what does it take to be a woman in supply chain</span></strong></p>\n<p>It takes balls to be in this business. It takes dedication, hard headedness and character. You work hard, you are also expected to play hard. And you do, to a point. But I love to tell my kids (son and a daughter) about things I’ve done, and places I have been where not many people would dare to go to obtain business, like Haiti. But you do, you take more risks then men. Because there are other things in life but work so it’s easier.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">5. What advice do you have for Women In Supply Chain™?</span></strong></p>\n<p>Don’t change who you are, put your foot down when it is right, and enjoy your work. Supply chain is a multi-layered cake: you need to be the chains, and the missing link in the chain, and the next step in the chain. Prediction is prevention so always (always) look 10 steps ahead.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">6. What risks have you taken?</span></strong></p>\n<p>I have not changed many jobs. When I did, it was always because something didn’t feel right. Whether the balance of home and work was becoming a mess, or the position really was not for me. My prior position was completely wrong for me with repetitive work. So, I left quite quickly.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, be honest with yourself. If something isn’t right, take the plunge and make that change.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">7. How do you balance work and family?</span></strong></p>\n<p>Before I was absolutely rubbish at finding a balance, hence my divorce. I was travelling too much, working way too much and not seeing my kids enough. Now, I am lucky I can work from home at times as well.  I still work hard, but at hours that are a bit more flexible. I have my boss to thank for that, again I am extremely lucky.</p>\n<p>Work is hugely important, but one cannot forego the love and the responsibilities that your family life brings. If you do, it will hit you in the face eventually.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">8. What needs to change in supply chain?</span></strong></p>\n<p>Supply chain is not an old concept, but it has great opportunities now for innovation. It is not an exhausted field, and it is dying for new ideas and creativity. We can all bargain for prices but can you work on the puzzle of how to make improvements without cutting physical costs?</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">9. What do you want generation Z to know about supply chain?</span></strong></p>\n<p>Ask yourself two questions: First, is this really the industry or job that you want? And second, what&#8217;s your passion that will keep you going when you don&#8217;t want to do it anymore?</p>\n<p>Do a lot research and some soul searching. Find somewhere in the supply chain where you can incorporate your vision and passion and then try to link the two and pursue it. That can be your niche.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">10. What’s next for you? </span></strong></p>\n<p>I’m continuing on the road that I am, because this is part of the future. At CargoSnap, we are educating people with our solution, we show them that supply chain can be different, it can be better. The focus nowadays is on how to make it easier for everyone, and that is what we are trying to do, making old processes easier.</p>\n",

She has more than fifteen years of experience in project management. And what drives her is empowering other women to build their careers in logistics. In fact, she set up the first logistics company to employ woman truck drivers in Ghana, West Africa.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Felicia shares how she found herself on her career path and what makes her passionate about supply chain:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What brought you to Supply Chain?</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I studied a course in Supply Chain for my master’s and then later, Ladybird Logistics launched my career into the Supply Chain space. In November 2017, I bumped into an old Shell colleague, Douglas McArthur. He introduced me to William Tewiah, the CEO of Zen Petroleum Limited. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">William and his friend, Yaw had a dream of starting the first ever “All female” logistics company and needed someone to make it a reality. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I knew next to nothing about trucks or the logistics industry, but I thrive on challenges and have a passion for empowering other women. The opportunity appealed to me —the idea was radical and challenging. </span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400; text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt; color: #000000;\">What is the support network like for women in Logistics in West Africa?</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ghanaian Women In Supply Chain™ have a great support network in </span><a href=\"https://www.wilat.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WiLAT</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, (Women in Logistics and Transport).

What risks have you taken on your way to your current career path?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve taken two major risks that brought me where I am today. First, taking a career break without assurance of securing a position after the break. And taking on the challenges of Ladybird Logistics without any prior knowledge of Logistics or transport. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt; color: #000000;\">3.What’s your advice to other women facing similar challenges?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simply pray and then go with your conviction.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is your goal right now?</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s good to have work life balance. I don’t have a balance, I am working on it. My strategy is to plan and then stick with the plan. When it’s time for work, I work. When it’s time for family, I spend that time in the moment with them.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; color: #000000;\">5. What do you want the next generation of Women In Supply Chain™ in Ghana to know?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Join WiLAT and follow your dreams. Whatever your dream is, believe that everything is possible with God and work hard to achieve it. Approach all relationships with genuine sincerity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And I cannot even stress that enough. We can all be better while supporting one another. So be authentic regardless of gender, and be willing to give support and to ask for it. We can all improve and help to make the experience better for everyone through authentic connections.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt; color: #000000;\"><i>Meet our Sponsor</i></span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This Women In Supply Chain™ feature was made possible by our sponsor, HULFT.

That’s right, Logistics. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9m7d07k22A\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">John Oliver’s video on warehouses</a> has racked up 5.9 million views this month. And it’s all about the dark side of warehousing, with shocking stats like this one from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics that injuries of warehouse employees outnumber coal miners, construction workers and loggers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">If you don’t want to watch the video, let me give you the highlights. John Oliver touched on <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/21/business/pregnancy-discrimination-miscarriages.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">disturbing reports</a> on one warehouse’s workers who were denied breaks. Some of those workers miscarried and one died of a cardiac arrest after being short of breath. One worker posted from the warehouse on Facebook: “THEY’RE REALLY TRYING TO MAKE US WORK AND THIS LADY DEAD BODY IS STILL IN THE BUILDING.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">And of course, on the eve of Amazon Prime Day, the segment highlighted the eCommerce and logistics leader. While disclaiming that Amazon “isn’t the worst” in the warehousing industry and sharing that they’d raised employee hourly pay to $15.00, Oliver continued on to share working conditions communicated by employees on camera. One senior man described walking 15-17 miles a day over a ten-hour shift to which Oliver quipped, “how badly do you really need those Tide Pods?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Video after video of Amazon workers of every age aired speaking of the impossible working conditions—sprinting across a warehouse the size of two football fields. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Speaking of airing your grievances on social, Amazon’s SVP of Operations, Dave Clark, took to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davehclark/status/1145702599435284480\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">twitter</a> to air his, read more <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davehclark/status/1145702599435284480\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">HERE</a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Clark clarified that he is a fan of the show, but rebutted the episode saying John Oliver is wrong about Amazon. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The result? The Twitter feed erupted with complaints about working conditions from consumers and previous workers. Although one adamant and bot-like “Amazon FC Advocate” continued tweeting how great her work experience has been. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">And while Amazon does not release its sales numbers, <a href=\"https://www.retaildive.com/news/what-5-stats-say-about-prime-day-2019/558750/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Retail Dive</a> estimated that the company was poised to rake in $5.8 billion this year. That’s after all the news reporting and outrage expressed across various social mediums. So what have we learned?</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Here are 3 reasons you should ensure your warehouse workers have the best working conditions, (good karma aside):</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18pt; color: #000000;\">1. Anyone can see inside your warehouse.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Thanks to social media. Workers at almost every warehouse mentioned in the news segment posted about negative working conditions—some of them while on the warehouse floor. One worker even (anonymously) shared Amazon’s video on halting workers’ attempts at unionizing on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQeGBHxIyHw\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube</a>. (Yes, this is real.)</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">So keep in mind that no matter what social media policy you have in place—modern day activism is just a couple clicks away—angry employees will take their fight to the platforms. So agree or not, be mindful that anything that occurs within the walls of your warehouse and corporate offices can be shared with the public in seconds.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18pt; color: #000000;\">2. Social commerce isn’t just a trend.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">With millennials making up more than half of the American workforce by 2020, you can imagine how many of them are already Head of Household shoppers. And they want <a href=\"https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/brands-unwilling-to-commit-to-a-set-of-values-risk-losing-consumers/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">brands whose values identify with theirs</a>. In fact according to the National Retail Federation (NRF), 60% of consumers would say sayonara to their favorite brand if their values don’t mesh. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Now, in fairness to Amazon, they frequently offer tours of their warehouses (an opportunity Oliver and his producers declined) to share working conditions with their shoppers and potential employees.  And in case you’re wondering, no, unfortunately I didn’t have time to stop by one of their warehouses before I started this blog. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">But it poses a question. How can you share your worker-friendly conditions? And that brings us to my last point which I blogged about in <a href=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/3-amazon-moves-you-need-to-know-about-now-and-how-you-can-compete/\">3 Amazon Moves You Need to Know About Now and How You Can Compete</a>.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18pt; color: #000000;\">3. Great working conditions make you competitive.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Achieving ridiculously competitive working conditions and benefits isn’t just the right thing to do, it’s the smart one. Even if you aren’t Amazon-sized you can compete and in more ways than one. There’s a historical shortage of long haul truckers and warehouse workers for retailers, 3PLs and logistics companies to hire. Position your benefits upfront across social media, your company’s LinkedIn page and boiler plate job descriptions. Basically everywhere.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">You can also share your working conditions in real ways—have press outlets come tour warehouses on opening day. Have your employees talk about their experience and what makes it so different from other warehouses (without naming names). Make your human initiative part of your company mission—so when consumers shop your brand they know they are supporting the most ethical working conditions. Because it matters.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; color: #000000;\">About the Author:<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-14564 size-full alignright\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NSW-300x300-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NSW-300x300-1.png 300w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NSW-300x300-1-150x150.png 150w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NSW-300x300-1-100x100.png 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /> </span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Naomi Garnice (She/Her/Hers) is a Senior Manager, Supply Chain Solutions Marketing at Anaplan where she supports brand awareness and expansion—leading marketers to simplify supply chain planning, make it profitable, and ignite agility by integrating other key business planning areas.

I sought out a career in supply chain—specifically in the international logistics segment—after studying abroad in Italy followed by an undergrad international business law course. We started talking about bills of lading and international Commerce. I was hooked. </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The appeal of world travel may have had something to do with it too, but it was the idea of the constant complexity. This dynamic environment made me think I would never get bored. There would always be new challenges; something to learn and that would excite me throughout life. So far, I was right. </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I was fortunate to find a position at Samuel Shapiro as a Junior Region Specialist. I cut bills of lading, tracked cargo and helped the Transportation department doing whatever they needed. I dove in hard, and I loved it. My entire tenure in the industry has been at Shapiro, my first and only home.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Where has the chain taken you from there?</span></strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I&#8217;ve been given amazing opportunities over the years. I&#8217;ve expanded my knowledge base and my skill sets and have been challenged in each and every role. I&#8217;ve been lucky enough to be supported by both my peers and my leaders. And while I know that no path is always easy, but I consider myself lucky each time. </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I&#8217;ve always been able to contribute to our company&#8217;s mission, and that is wonderfully fulfilling. Currently I am the Director of Supply Chain. I have the pleasure of overseeing the logistics side of our operations and the privilege of working closely with our IT Department to drive our Logistics and Supply Chain management platforms forward. </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I contribute to propelling our 100-year old organization forward into the next 100 years—that’s an honor.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">What have your hurdles been along the way?</span></strong></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">It’s tough to be the new kid on the block. The first thing I noticed working in Freight forwarding and Customs Brokerage is that this industry is heavily relationship-based. Everyone seems to know everyone from a prior role, employer or project. So being a new face was really intimidating at first. </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I had amazing people who guided me and helped me understand the interconnectedness of the business. The people I&#8217;ve met have helped me overcome these challenges and make the work more rewarding. I want to do the same for the Next Generation.</span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Secondly, expertise is heavily experience-based, especially in international Logistics and Customs Brokerage. You can’t simply study to know how to deal with the challenges we encounter each day. Building an arsenal of solutions took time and a real commitment to learning; I&#8217;ve made myself into a sponge and absorbed every drop. I want to pass that message forward: how we can support one another in giving people experiences, bringing others to the table and including people who want to grow in the industry. I want to be the hand that extends to help bring others into the community.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #000000; font-size: 18pt;\">How do you maintain trust when dealing with issues outside of your control, (like many in freight forwarding and logistics)?</span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">                      </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Trust is earned. I&#8217;ve had incredible mentors along the way who helped shape my leadership perspective and style and through that I&#8217;ve been given the chance to prove myself over the years to both my teammates and to management. We aren&#8217;t a hands-off company. I don&#8217;t think this is a hands-off business for leaders in general. So the chance to dig in with my teams for over a decade has been rewarding, but has also helped us established a great deal of trust. </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">That&#8217;s the role I want to play, that we all support one another, and we develop that mutual trust. Fighting fires in our business is one thing, but it&#8217;s what you do after the fire is out, the customers are happy the freight is delivered that things return to business as usual for me. </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">That&#8217;s where I dig in as a leader and determine how we prevent this fire next time. We all face issues that are out of our control but understanding what I could control to prevent it is essential to success.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Always work to find the root cause to make sure you don&#8217;t face that same fire again. Philosophically as a leader, this is something I learned very early on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Another point is to embrace your failures. I&#8217;m happy to share them. I&#8217;ll own them. I&#8217;ll learn from them. I&#8217;ll be the cautionary tale for everyone, and I&#8217;ll do better next time. It&#8217;s a developed humility over the years that my teams, my peers and my leadership recognize and take the same approach so we are continuing to support each other and growing together.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #000000; font-size: 18pt;\">How are you helping to drive your business forward?</span></strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">When I see a manual process, my first thought is <em>why</em>? In our business we can all agree there are a lot of manual processes. There&#8217;s a lot of paperwork required to make our industry run. We all look at it from a different angle. </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">We see different opportunity and choosing to tackle it, knowing where we are going and where we are strategically moving towards is paramount. </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">There&#8217;s a remarkable amount of data being exchanged. We&#8217;re always asking, <em>do we have good data? </em>We are exchanging it, both sending and receiving, and it must be timely. There are many providers coming into the space, more than I&#8217;ve ever seen, and that’s so exciting. But it’s important to know the correct partners and how they fit into this new space. And then what we choose to do with our tech investment—how we choose to spend our resources, making our process as efficient as possible—removing manual work, eliminating waste and errors in the process.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: comic sans ms, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;\">There&#8217;s so much opportunity for innovation there—we’re in a transformative state, it&#8217;s exciting.</span></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #000000; font-size: 18pt;\">How can women supply chain leaders like you build relationships with clients in our male-dominated industry?</span></strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">My entire career has been spent at an organization run by a woman, the #1 woman-owned business in Baltimore. So, throughout my entire professional experience, the tone has been set that regardless of whether it&#8217;s a male-dominated industry or a woman-owned business, building relationships should not be gender-influenced. </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Approach all relationships with genuine sincerity; I cannot stress that enough. We can all be better while supporting one another. So be authentic regardless of gender and be willing to give support and to ask for it. </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">We are all improving and helping to make the experience better for everyone through real authentic connections.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #000000; font-size: 18pt;\">What’s the best advice you have for our readers?</span></strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Recognize the complexity of what we do in supply chain because it&#8217;s really fascinating, and make opportunity where you don&#8217;t see one. My career has been built on opportunities that may or may not have really been available. </span><strong><em><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Seize the moment, go for it and take a chance on asking for more; on asking for an experience and asking to learn.

In the first quarter of the year, Mexico eclipsed Canada and China to become the largest American trading partner with an estimated $50 billion a month in imports and exports through this year. The tariffs Trump has planned are sweeping, including almost everything coming north across the border. And since they aren’t targeted in the typical way tariffs are usually levied, the impact could be as dramatic on our economy and our supply chains.</p>\n<p>Rufus Yerxa, president of the National Foreign Trade Council <a href=\"http://www.nftc.org/newsflash/newsflash.asp?Mode=View&amp;id=236&amp;articleid=4189&amp;category=All\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said taxing imports</a> from Mexico is a “dangerous and destabilizing move” and moreover, a “terrible economic policy”.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Logistics Industry is Moving, Fast</p>\n<p>According to the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics, U.S.-Mexico trade rose 10.2% last year over the year previous. And the logistics segment is positioned to get hit—hard.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce revealed that Texas is positioned to be hit the hardest by the tariffs proposed on Mexican products, followed by Michigan, California, Illinois and Ohio. A 25% tariff come October would jeopardize $26.75 billion of Texas imports.</p>\n<p>Trucks moved almost 70% of the goods trade by value across the American Mexico border last year. Vigorous trade flows have sparked dramatic investments in warehouses close to the border as demand started to outpace supply.</p>\n<p>And this isn’t the first time border control issues and politics have impacted the U.S. logistics industry. Truck shipments were stalled this spring as the U.S. Customs and Border Protections staffed <a href=\"https://www.sdcexec.com/risk-compliance/news/21062903/wait-times-worsen-at-usmexico-border\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">more agents at checkpoints</a> for Border Patrol. What was the result? Longer backups. Backups that can only extend if the threatened tariffs trigger a boost in northbound demand—a surge that is already being felt.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1156 alignright\" src=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Logistics-is-moving-fast-200x300.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Logistics-is-moving-fast-200x300.jpeg 200w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Logistics-is-moving-fast-600x900.jpeg 600w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Logistics-is-moving-fast-683x1024.jpeg 683w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Logistics-is-moving-fast-768x1152.jpeg 768w, https://letstalksupplychain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Logistics-is-moving-fast.jpeg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" />The Demand is Unstoppable</p>\n<p>Some importers have already started strategizing shipping goods more quickly into the states from Mexico ahead of the threatened tariffs according to the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/logistics-operators-brace-for-import-rush-ahead-of-u-s-tariffs-on-mexico-products-11559329796\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Wall Street Journal</a>. The current political and economic climate is setting the stage for shipments to explode at an already congested border with limited warehouse and trucking capacity.</p>\n<p>Frank McGuigan, chief executive of Frisco, the Texas-based transportation management and logistics operator with an abundant presence along the southern American border shared with the WSJ that major companies are saying they need to start moving their goods. It’s happening already.</p>\n<p>“Shippers are saying, ‘What are our options?’” McGuigan told the publication. “Right now, you need capacity and you need speed… This is the very definition of supply chain disruption.”</p>\n<p>Disruption is Coming</p>\n<p>How are you responding?

    "content": "<p>&#8220;Your podcast had significantly helped me learn about other areas of supply chain outside of trucking and grow my career. Thank you for all the work that you do&#8221; &#8211; Erica Howell</p>\n<p>So, when I started my Women In Supply Chain™ Series on the podcast, I never could have imagined the support it would receive and how many amazing messages I would receive from all over the world about how much other women relate to the powerhouses that I am featuring in this series.</p>\n<p>Well, Erica is one of those women and she emailed me and said, “I recently found your profile and more importantly, your podcast because of a comment you made on a LinkedIn post. I wanted to send you a thank you for the work you do and the value you bring to me and the industry. I’ve been listening to the podcast on Stitcher. I’ve been trying to learn more about supply chain big picture to bring my clients more value. Your podcast had significantly helped me learn about other areas of supply chain outside of trucking and grow my career. Thank you for all the work that you do,” and so because of that email and because she reached out, and I just loved the energy that came from that email, I am so glad to be introducing you and featuring Erica in the main blog of my Women In Supply Chain™ Series.</p>\n<p>interviewee-text interviewer-text&#8221;&gt;So, Erica, first of all, I want to say thank you for all your support and I really appreciate you trusting me to tell your story and your journey to success today.</p>\n<p><strong>Erica:</strong> Thanks, Sarah, I’m really excited to be here.</p>\n<p><strong>LTSC:</strong> Awesome, awesome! So, let’s get started. Why don’t you give us a glimpse into your journey? Who is Erica? How did you get into supply chain, and what are you doing now?</p>\n<p><strong>Erica:</strong> Well, Sarah, I got started in the industry about 10 years ago as a customer service representative at a trucking company. I had no idea what I was getting into, but I knew that I could figure it out. I was a single mom at the time and I need to support my two-year-old son. That initial job helped me truly understand trucking 101 operations and the markets. Today, collaborating with shippers, creating scalable e-commerce solutions at Schneider. I really see it as an opportunity to shape the future in an over-dimensional and final mile logistics. Most people don’t know that a couple of years ago, Schneider got into the final mile field, becoming the largest asset provider by acquisition. For me, it’s a really exciting opportunity to help shippers create massive success.</p>\n<p><strong>LTSC:</strong> I love that, it sounds like you are just so passionate about what you do. You started out in the career not really knowing what it was and what you are going to be doing, and now, you’re just a passionate about it. So, how did that come about?</p>\n<p><strong>Erica:</strong> Well, throughout life, I’ve been someone who sees myself as a fighter. No matter what challenges come our way, I believe we can figure them out, and in trucking and logistics, there are always problems to solve. No day is the same. I think it was a lot for me about proving to myself that I could learn the different pieces and help my customers to achieve a different future then they even realize is possible.</p>\n<p><strong>LTSC:</strong> Awesome. So, as a woman in the industry, what does it mean to hear from other Women In Supply Chain™? I mean, you mentioned in your email to me that that was something you enjoy, the Women In Supply Chain™ Series, so why is that? What does it mean to you as a woman in supply chain?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Erica:</strong> Sarah, the women you interview don’t sugarcoat their stories. They are genuine, they share their struggles, and I really dig that. You get each “superwoman,”to openly share their struggles. Every woman in this series could have chosen to be a victim at some point in their lives, but instead, they share with you and the listeners or readers how they took control, made it happen, conquered their mountains and created their own success. I think the vulnerability that is shared establishes a connection with the readers and listeners. It’s super relatable.</p>\n<p><strong>LTSC:</strong> Yeah, and sorry, but just to jump in there, the authenticity, right? I try to keep the episodes really authentic and I hope that comes across, and I think that’s really what gives it dimension.</p>\n<p><strong>Erica:</strong> It does. You ask great follow-up questions and really probe, and I think there is a trust that the women and people you interview are willing to give you in sharing their stories in that authenticity. The general nature of the conversations, and then these women’s ability to be vulnerable. It’s super powerful.</p>\n<p><strong>LTSC:</strong> Absolutely! So, you talk about climbing mountains. I love your analogy of what some of the stories have meant to you. Let’s talk about your mountain – what were some of the challenges that you overcame and how did you overcome them?</p>\n<p><strong>Erica:</strong> I think there are several mountains I’ve had. I had some challenges in my childhood with my parents and things weren’t always easy to come by. So, I learned at an early age to own whatever the problems were and make it a choice. We can choose to accept things as they are today, or we can decide that things are going to be different. Then, we go out and make it happen. When I got done with high school, one of the challenges I faced was I had a scholarship for college or I could stick around and take care of my four brothers and sisters. I chose to forgo college, work two full-time jobs, and take care of my siblings because that was most important to me. I look back at all of the opportunities that I was given. Any successful person I have talked to, really, they look back at those choices that they make as pivot points in how they define themselves in their lives. I think it’s such an important distinction because we all get those opportunities every day. There are bad circumstances that happen to all of us. We can choose to make the best of the situation or we can choose to look at ourselves as victims of circumstance, and accept things as they are.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>LTSC:</strong> Wow, I love how you have put that and that is such an important piece to your story, right? You chose family first, and I think with a lot of women, when I talk to them in this series, there’s always that question of work-life balance, or maybe in your case, sort of school-life balance, and at some points in the career, I think it was Kristy that said this, you focus on family first. In some points of your career, you focus on career first, and I think that the example that you have just given is a very beautiful example because you had that choice early on and at that point in your life, you chose the family first.</p>\n<p><strong>Erica:</strong> Yeah, and I think we go through different seasons in life. Sometimes, we have to put work first, other times, it’s family. We may not be able to spend as much time with family, especially as we grow our logistics or supply chain careers, but understanding that it’s okay. I heard a woman speaker and I can’t think of her name right now, but she talked about how we need to remember not to feel guilty. Either one that we put is our priority, whether it’s work or home, women have the tendency to feel guilty or that they owe that other part of their life something. We need to realize that it’s okay to go through different seasons of life.</p>\n<p><strong>LTSC:</strong> Yeah, and it’s all about choosing that perspective, like you were talking about, right? You can choose whether to be the victim or you can choose whether to look back on that as a pivot point, and something that boosted you, either in your career or in your family life.</p>\n<p><strong>Erica:</strong> Yes, you are exactly right, and I try to learn from others’ experiences. I’m a big reader and I listen to a lot of podcasts. Listening to the people that have “made it” in their career, they have become successful. They all define themselves by their ability to overcome those challenges when the odds seemed insurmountable. That perspective and gratitude that they have is so important.</p>\n<p><strong>LTSC:</strong> Absolutely. So, I mean, you’ve grown your career, you’ve started in this industry fairly young, so you are a young professional in trucking right now, and I think that it’s really important to take a look at it, not only from a young professional standpoint but also from an employer standpoint to really get an understanding of what that next generation, what that young professional is looking for from an employer. That traditional thinking has stopped in its tracks, whether it’s technology, innovation, but we don’t talk about culture and workplace enough, and that’s not necessarily a diversity conversation, but it’s just the workplace conversation. So, I want to ask you, as a young professional, what are you looking for in the workplace and what are you looking for from your employer?</p>\n<p><strong>Erica:</strong> Yeah, you are spot on. Things are different now, and we’ve seen such rapid change over the past decade in what employees expect, some of the generational impact, and it goes far beyond diversity. For me, I want authenticity. It’s one of the reasons I chose my current company and that I’m still here, but there are a lot of companies that don’t live out the values that they claim to have, and you are seeing the impact of that in their struggle to find employees. Every company and individual has challenges like we were talking about earlier. If a company takes feedback seriously and acknowledges those opportunities for growth, their employees, especially young employees, will engage in driving that improvement and that change. It will be organic. Instead of having to invest in outside sources coming in to fix the company or address culture, they really can get their employee engagement in shaping that better future. Simultaneously, that drives employee loyalty.</p>\n<p><strong>LTSC:</strong> Yeah, and I struggle with this a lot because I hear about the talent shortage, not necessarily from the young professionals, obviously, but I hear it from the top, the C-suite, those executives, we have a talent shortage; there’s not enough talent out there, and I struggle with that because I think that there is a lot of talent, and I’m not sure if it’s because a young professional isn’t portraying it properly or if the employer is not looking for it properly, – and the reason why I say that is because jobs are changing. Again, I’m going to say tradition is thrown out the window. We need technology people on our supply chain teams. We need supply chain professionals with technology backgrounds, we need so many different ways of thinking to be able to move the business forward and to keep on top of everything that I’m not sure where that gap is. So, I want to pose that to you: where is that gap? What are your thoughts on this?</p>\n<p><strong>Erica:</strong> Have you ever listened to Simon Sinek?</p>\n<p><strong>LTSC:</strong> I have heard of him. I’m not sure where from…</p>\n<p><strong>Erica:</strong> He’s an author, motivational speaker, and a consultant to companies. He talks a lot about culture and leadership, how employers are quick to write off an employee, but they wouldn’t do that with their own child. He talked about how organizations need to own the fact that there are differences between the generations and how the millenial generation really grew up having things easy. They had things handed to them. They grew up with the internet, having cell phones, so they are used to that instant gratification, but that if we, as leaders, take a different approach and how we address the different types of employees in our organizations, we can make a difference and tap into those talents that aren’t being presented right by the younger generation.</p>\n<p><strong>LTSC:</strong> Absolutely. So, what would you say then to an employer or what would you say to a young professional? Is there any tips that you would throw their way as a solution to this discussion, this big discussion that’s happening right now?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Erica:</strong> Getting through to employers, it’s about being genuine and authentic in seeking feedback. A lot of employers are quick to look for their customers to give feedback and to make changes based on customer feedback, but how often are they looking for that feedback internally from their own employees? It’s not always very often that these organizations seek out that feedback, and then pose the question back to your employees when they have a concern and ask them, “Well, how do you think we should solve it?” Allow those employees to take ownership of how they go and change the organization. Having that mindset and allowing young professionals to impact the future of the organization will be monumental in creating that loyalty and helping drive the success of the culture going forward. For young professionals, my advice would be, there are no shortcuts or easy buttons. I think sometimes, it’s that mentality of instant gratification, they want it and they want it now. Instead of expecting your results instantly, ask your leaders and other successful people in your life, “Hey, can you help me figure out the path of how I can get to this outcome? What are the things that I need to do or what can I act on starting today to make that outcome possible?” We need to do the hard work. Serving those around you is so important in making yourself successful. If we are interested in serving those around us in making others successful, our own success is just a byproduct. We need to listen to different perspectives and be open, not silo ourselves into one mindset because then, we stop growing.</p>\n<p><strong>LTSC:</strong> Yeah, and I’m going to add two things to that that I think are vital to what you just said, and one of them is listening. Make sure you actually listen, take notes, really listen to that feedback, and number two is take action because it’s important that you get feedback, but you cannot be paralyzed in action. You have to be able to put 1 foot in front of the other and start putting those things into action every single day. Doesn’t need to be everything all at once, but it does need to be one thing.</p>\n<p><strong>Erica:</strong> Yeah, and I think for millennials and some of the other younger generations, they have heard people say so much but do very little.They want action and like you are explaining, even little actions go a long way. Maybe the organization makes some mistakes when they are trying to get to that end result, but sharing that struggle with your employees and saying, “Here, we tried this. Here is the intent. This didn’t quite work out the way we had planned, but here is where we are going to tweak it. We’re going to try it differently and still go after that outcome.”</p>\n<p><strong>LTSC:</strong> Yeah, opening up that to a communication, but one of the things that I am going to throw in there too as a young professional, if you don’t know how to do anything or you don’t know how to do the thing that your leader is asking you to do, you have enough resources around you, YouTube, Google, that kind of thing, don’t ever go back and say you don’t know how to do it.</p>\n<p><strong>Erica:</strong> So true, and I think it’s easy to say, “I don’t know how to do it,” but we have more resources available to us today at our fingertips than at any point in history. Organizations also are very supportive of their employees reaching out to other resources in the organization, and for a young professional, hey, reaching out to others in the organization gives you a chance to get mentors, people who take you under their wing that can help you build your success in the future.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>LTSC:</strong> Yeah, and not even internally. I would even say utilizing LinkedIn a little bit more. I think that LinkedIn is underutilized by a lot of people, and in my case, it was underutilized for a long time, and now that I’m in this space, I can see how much it can really make or break a career, and I think that getting involved in LinkedIn, getting connected with other people, bringing the value to those people that you want to have a connection with, engaging, commenting, liking, sharing, sharing valuable information that you come across I think is super, super important for anybody’s career.</p>\n<p><strong>Erica:</strong> I agree. Why do you think it is that people are reluctant to get engaged with the LinkedIn community?</p>\n<p><strong>LTSC:</strong> I’m not sure. I think people are hesitant because they are not entirely sure what to do with it because Facebook is one thing. You can block people, you can have your posse on Facebook and you can post whatever you want, and its private and nobody can see it et cetera, et cetera. Instagram is more pictures, it’s more your thoughts, whereas LinkedIn is professional. So, where is that line? What do you put on there? But it’s work as well. That’s the other thing about LinkedIn. LinkedIn, there’s a lot more work than the other two because LinkedIn is articles and thought leadership pieces, right? It’s positioning yourself as a thought leader in your industry, but the people that put in the work on LinkedIn, those are the ones that are maximizing their exposure and getting most out of the platform.</p>\n<p><strong>Erica:</strong> That’s a great point.</p>\n<p><strong>LTSC:</strong> Yeah, so I really think that internally, it’s great because you have access to those people and you already have a commonality, but I think that LinkedIn is that platform that you can network with anybody globally around the world and position yourself as a thought leader in your career, but it takes –</p>\n<p><strong>Erica:</strong> consistency.</p>\n<p><strong>LTSC:</strong> You have to be willing to put in that work. Yes, consistecy, but I mean – and you don’t necessarily need to write articles, but if you’re commenting on people’s posts and you’re commenting with really thoughtful answers or thoughtful comments, or asking questions, I think that people are going to look at you a lot differently than if you’re just going through and liking everything.</p>\n<p><strong>Erica:</strong> True.</p>\n<p><strong>LTSC:</strong> So, let’s get to the next question. I want to talk to you about the trucking space. I don’t actually have a lot of people on the show, I don’t know why, but I don’t get to talk about trucking a lot. I’ve been out of sort of that realm for a little bit, so I want to sort of find out from your perspective, I know that Ellen Voie and <a href=\"https://www.womenintrucking.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Women in Trucking</a> and making a lot of really great strides in the trucking industry for women. Your answer doesn’t necessarily need to be around women and diversity, but I just want to see what’s going on with the trucking space and what would you like to see more of in the trucking space.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Erica:</strong> Yeah, in the trucking space, I think we are in an extreme time right now. Last year, the capacity struggles put drivers in charge of the market. This year, the markets softened up and shippers are now in control, and there is this pendulum that swings back and forth that changes the dynamics in the industry. That creates a lot of strain on relationships between shippers and carriers, but you also have a lot of disruption and innovation happening. It’s very exciting to see all of this unfold in front of our eyes. I feel like we are in the time of Thomas Edison, the lightbulb, and all of these new technologies are coming out that are going to change the industry forever. I don’t know that we really recognize it because we are in the day-to-day, but that innovation is going to continue to push people. It’s part of the reason I say we need to listen to different perspectives. We need to talk to people in the industry on LinkedIn like you were talking about earlier, but really understand what everyone is seeing. Identify what’s working for others. Irina that you had on your show, I think it was a few months ago, but she talks about this a lot too and she shares great valuable content about best practices, but doing more of that in the industry will help all of us as we figure out things like final mile logistics and e-commerce. I don’t think anybody has it completely figured out, but the more that we can collaborate and share information, the better off we all will be.</p>\n<p><strong>LTSC:</strong> I would absolutely agree with that because I don’t think anybody has it right. I think people are constantly learning, constantly trying new things, and that is the way that it should be, and it’s going to be like that, I think forever because the knowledge base is changing so quickly that things are changing so fast, and we need to keep up with it, we need to keep ahead of it, we can’t stay behind it. So, I think that we are constantly going to have to adapt to change and people are going to have to be comfortable with change.</p>\n<p><strong>Erica:</strong> Yeah, and it’s interesting. Now that I’m in the final mile side, I have noticed that there are companies out there and retailers that are frozen. They are not really sure how to do e-commerce and final mile logistics, especially with over-dimensional freight. They are afraid to take that risk. They’re worried about implementing a plan that doesn’t get the right results. I have cautioned companies to be careful that they don’t freeze because they are so scared to make that decision or believe that it’s too much risk to even try to go into e-commerce. I think if companies keep that mentality, they are going to be left behind.</p>\n<p><strong>LTSC:</strong> Absolutely. I would definitely agree with that. Okay, so now, before we wind down this interview, I want to know what’s next for Erica? What are you looking forward to in the future of your career?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Erica:</strong> Well, I’m really excited with where I am at today and being a part of the e-commerce world, helping shippers figure that out in the future. I love the leadership skills that I have learned. I’ve got a great leader gave me some great advice a while back about making time, making time for myself every morning, doing positive self-talk, as silly as it sounds, but really helping to invest in myself to build up my confidence. As women, I don’t know that we do that enough. So, I continually look for ways that I can improve myself, continue to learn – I’m a part of Toastmasters [0:27:27] which has been great. It’s a great resource for any listeners to help them in the industry, networking and build confidence as they grow their career. I’m not really sure if I’ll end up going into leadership or a different area of trucking or supply chain, but I’m excited to see what the future holds.</p>\n<p><strong>LTSC:</strong> Awesome. Well, I’m excited to see where you are going next, and self-talk is absolutely a necessary thing for everybody to do. I don’t know if you listened to my most recent episode with Denise MacDonald, but she talks about meditation and self-talk, affirmations. I do affirmations every single morning when I’m walking the dogs. I do my affirmations, and it is critical to mental health. So, I’m glad you brought it up and I’m excited to see where you are going, and I just appreciate you coming on the blog and sharing your story today, Erica.</p>\n<p><strong>Erica:</strong> Thank you, Sarah, I really appreciate all you do for women and supply chain. I think the stories that you share really help all of us become more successful and understand that our challenges are not just faced by us.</p>\n",

So, let’s get started. What does success mean to you?</p>\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Audrey:</div>\n<p>Success means to me, just feeling confident and good about what you are doing, what your purpose is in what’s going on in your life. It’s not necessarily the same thing for every person, but whatever you have chosen in your career, in your life is what is making you happy and what is giving meaning and service back into the world.</p>\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold;\">LTSC:</div>\n<p>I love that you co-relate success and meaning because I think success and meaning go hand-in-hand, but we don’t really talk about it enough. Would you agree with that?</p>\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Audrey:</div>\n<p>Yeah, I would agree with that for sure. I think success often gets caught up in – we get caught up in material things and in the day-to-day grind of life like bills and thinking that we are in the place of lacking, but really finding meaning in what you are doing, finding meaning in the relationships that you have, having gratitude for that, really appreciating the kind of people who are in and around your life in all the areas of it. I think for me, that is what I try to focus on the most instead of comparing my life to other people’s ideas of what success is where possible. It is a challenge.</p>\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold;\">LTSC:</div>\n<p>Beautiful, and you know what, if I saw that as a post, I would hashtag that truth.</p>\n<p>All right, so let’s get into the journey. Tell us about your journey to success. Where did you start and what have you done along the way?</p>\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Audrey:</div>\n<p>Okay, well – gosh, where do I start? I was definitely lucky I have a really, really loving and supportive family, so I think I was lucky to start – to start there, and they have been and still are my kind of cheerleaders along the way, but yeah, I started, I did the usual, I went through school. I was lucky I went to an art school and really got to experience a variety of programs and educational experience, met some great people. I went on to university, I did not finish due to some family issues that I was having, but that was what lead to getting my first job as a summer student here at Orchard International, and once I got into Orchard, I just try to be open and try to be curious, and so I moved around here quite a bit doing different roles, helping the salesperson with meeting notes and with packing and pulling samples, all the way to doing global product development, local sourcing, purchasing and procurement, and really just along the way, just saying yes and being open to try new things. It’s been my journey and it has made for some great relationships and it has made for some really fun experiences along the way.</p>\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold;\">LTSC:</div>\n<p>I think it combined your art and creative side with supply chain.</p>\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Audrey:</div>\n<p>Yeah, for sure. I am the person who – I understand I have experience with kind of the technical and process orientation of supply-chain, right? It is process-driven, there is steps that you have to follow, and I think I have been given the opportunity to present it to people who are not necessarily familiar with it in a creative way, so I’ve had the opportunity to do some training&#8217;s internally which means I can explain the technical but while making it creative and while getting people, like our product development team &#8211; very creative and innovative people, it will paint a picture for them of this technical and somewhat tedious environments and just help get them to feel motivated and participate in those.</p>\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold;\">LTSC:</div>\n<p>Yeah, and that is super important, so kudos to you because that is not necessarily easy, but it comes with the sort of collaboration and communication side we have as females, I think, right?</p>\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Audrey:</div>\n<p>For sure, for sure, like I can just pick up on when people are not quite getting it and there’s just another way to re-frame it and communicate it just a little bit differently, and I really like, for fun, I like to laugh and have fun. I will send out emails about upcoming issues or something like a Chinese New Year, and I try to make it fun, like I try to put in cultural references and little jokes because I know for most people, it can get a bit dry, but I try to put a laugh into it, and I think my colleagues appreciate that. I usually get a little like, comment back like, “LOL, that was funny,” or “I actually read to the end of this email because I was waiting to see what little joke you put in there.” I think that just gets them to have some ownership over, like I said, what can be kind of a tedious or even boring process-oriented thing, but you kind of make it fun, and then it sinks in a little bit too, I think.</p>\n<p>LTSC:</p>\n</div>\n<p>Amazing, and I know your Twitter followers love it because you’re super witty on Twitter&#8230;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/tresaudrey?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">here</a> is where you can find Audrey on Twitter. So, let’s talk a little bit about diversity inclusion. You work for a company that’s female-led, you have been there for a while. So, what are your thoughts about diversity and inclusion in supply chain today?</p>\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Audrey:</div>\n<p>I think for Orchard, we started out and we are in the personal care and cosmetics industry which I mean, it may be is a natural fit for it to be women-led, but I think the company as a whole really recognizes the talent and the different leadership qualities that women can bring to the table. Another thing that I’m really kind of proud of at Orchard is that we are a very kind of multicultural and diverse employer. We have a lot of people from a lot of different backgrounds and it is a celebration here. I mean, we have these epic potluck lunches because we are all foodies here at Orchard, so it’s like, you get this kind of environment that is sharing each other’s cultures, that is learning from each other. languages, that is huge in supply chain, that is huge for helping us reach and interact, not just with our vendors and supply partners, but also our customers, and there is an active learning experience here, so that has been big for us, and I think it has really contributed to us growing as a company. I mean, we have pretty much always had a growth year, maybe it has been a smaller incremental growth in other years, but to be at a company that is consistently growing and doing better, I mean, that just speaks to how talented the people are here, and yeah, how committed we are to different viewpoints, different ideas and being innovative and not just technically innovative but kind of innovative as a culture and a company.</p>\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold;\">LTSC:</div>\n<p>Interesting, and I think that’s great, especially in Canada, I think we are a little bit further ahead than most in the diversity and the inclusion space, not only just in supply chain but in business in general.</p>\n<p>So, in your role at Orchard, you deal with all sorts of providers – Trucking companies, freight forwarders, carriers, and so much more. Have you come up against any challenges being a female in that space and how did you find your voice in amongst some of the male-dominated, mail-driven companies?</p>\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Audrey:</div>\n<p>That is such a good question. In transportation, it can certainly feel like you are the only woman in the room sometimes and I have come up against it a lot when it comes to decision-making. When I first started, I was fairly young as well and I definitely got push back or questioned, Some times asked are you sure you are the decision-maker? Is there someone else I can talk to? And at first, you kind of like, oh, wait, am I the decision-maker? And I would run to my boss and be like, well, I think this is what should happen, but they are asking for someone higher up, and I’m lucky I have such a great manager that he really pushed it. He said, do you think we should work with them because it’s you, you are making the decision. You are deciding based on your assessment, and I have to remember to trust in my experience and knowledge.</p>\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold;\">LTSC:</div>\n<p>right, I love that you have that support, that championing.</p>\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Audrey:</div>\n<p>I do.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold;\">LTSC:</div>\n<p>The confidence to go ahead and make the decisions and be okay if you do fail, right? You have to learn from mistakes and I say failure not as a really big huge deal; I talk about it being a learning experience. It’s maybe a little blip on the radar but they are allowing you to learn from and never do it again because they know that you are the type that is going to learn from it and move on.</p>\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Audrey:</div>\n<p>Yeah, like I might make a mistake but I’d never make the same mistake twice.Sometimes the mistake you make can be very, very elaborate, but I think it has been nice because – and you all see this in other industries and across the board, having the chance to fail helps you if you can cope with it in a healthy way. I struggled because, I would definitely dwell on things and I really was like, I would have people around me and it’s like that happens, it sucks. You’ve got to move on from it, okay? So, that was yesterday and now, we are on today and we are not going to do that again and this is how we are going to fix it, then you’ve got to move on from it, and I’m lucky to have examples of that through the connections I’ve made through social media, here at Orchard, but yeah, being able to make it, realize how it happened, be able to fix it and come away from it, but ultimately, to leave it behind you, that is where my growth is right now, is to leave it behind me and keep going.</p>\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold;\">LTSC:</div>\n<p>Yeah, and you had the chance to grow, right?</p>\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Audrey:</div>\n<p>Yeah, for sure, for sure, and because if I had not had that experience at all, if I had not been able to learn through small mistakes or little issues, then what if my mistake was big? – you could create this whole situation, a big huge issue that you just can’t recover from and that is detrimental to the company, but it’s also detrimental personally because then it’s like you don’t have any coping skills on what to do when that happens. So, yeah, I’m lucky I had that leeway and it helped me assess risk, that is how you gain that force, that experience that people talk of when things always moves smoothly for that person. It’s like yeah, because they’ve had years of little mistakes that help them prepare and plan for mitigating those risks.</p>\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold;\">LTSC:</div>\n<p>Absolutely, and I love the way you put that. So, what is your hope for the industry? Where do you see the future of supply chain either from my diversity standpoint, from maybe a shipper standpoint? What do you want to see?</p>\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Audrey:</div>\n<p>I think people, it can be such a – what’s a way to put this? It can be such a clunky kind of industry in a lot of ways, considering it’s transportation and considering you’re trying to get things to move quickly. I found kind of it’s still lagging in terms of being able to innovate and really take things to the next level, and think of what is going to happen 10 years from now. I really think it’s an industry that’s like, oh, we have trucks and they have wheels and big on these roads, and that’s how it is and that is how it’s done, but you can see that there’s lots of new transportation methods out there – I mean, drones which obviously, they might not be the best thing, but I find it sometimes the industry can be very like, “This is what we have done and this is how we have always done at,” so for me, especially working at a company like Orchard where we are very innovative, it’s like, what is after the wheel? What comes next? What’s going to happen in 10 years? How will we live in 15 years? And you know it’s going to be different because you can see that from history that life changes constantly, so for the industry to be a bit more open to the change and not even just be open, but being leaders on it, there’s been great ideas and there are some really great groups and organizations involved in and around shipping and supply chain, and if they could work together a little bit more and collaborate, they really could be leaders in infrastructure and innovation that may be I find there a bit lagging right now.</p>\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold;\">LTSC:</div>\n<p>Yeah, there is still too much separation, too much silo –</p>\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Audrey:</div>\n<p>Yeah, silo, that’s such a good word.</p>\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold;\">LTSC:</div>\n<p>We talk about us making progress, so it’s kind of funny hearing it from your perspective as a shipper who is in it every single day and talking to providers every single day saying, “Wait a second, we are nowhere close. You may think that you are making progress, but from where I sit, we are not. We got a long way to go, we got a lot of work to do.”</p>\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Audrey:</div>\n<p>Yeah.</p>\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold;\">LTSC:</div>\n<p>Right? And you brought up a really good point about innovation. As innovative as you are internally,if the people around you or in your supply chain are not innovating as fast as you are, that is going to create a problem. It is going to create a challenge and an issue, and how do we collaborate and work together instead of the blame game?</p>\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Audrey:</div>\n<p>Oh, for sure. Yeah, and when you look around the industry just as general consumers, like if you look at your cell phones have come, the mass changes in 10 years and it’s like you just see other industries like, hanging on like, “Well, we had this really good idea. It was a really good idea 20 years ago and congratulations, and here’s your award,” but like, okay, now, what’s next? When you are living, like humans change, humans evolve, and you watch people hunker down into these positions, you are like, you know what, there’s a place for tradition, but in the transportation industry, you really want to help your customers be successful to create a really integrated and smooth supply chain. You really want to be thinking of what is the next best solution, what is next, what can we do, how can we do it?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold;\">LTSC:</div>\n<p>Yeah, and it should come from the top down, not the bottom up. Well, ideally</p>\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Audrey:</div>\n<p>But I mean, or be collaborative, have the space, so that – I’m sure there’s lots of people in the bottom for getting started who are like, “Gosh, I have this really great idea,” and it’s like, “Oh, well, that’s not how we do it.” Well, then what’s going to change, right? Because they are the new consumer too, like when you look – the change has to come from the top, but like, if you’re not getting any feedback or a collaboration with the people who are on the front line or really the next wave of kind of consumers, or the next wave of people who are going to use your service, especially in – I think a lot of people talk about this in this Internet age, in the social media age, there’s really no excuse for not having feedback. I mean, it’s as easy as a free Internet poll, comment on my post, like there’s no way you are not getting or you don’t have access to a variety of feedback.</p>\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold;\">LTSC:</div>\n<p>Absolutely, I completely agree with that.</p>\n<p>So, now, let’s get into some advice. You’ve been in this industry for a while now.</p>\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Audrey:</div>\n<p>I’m ancient now in supply chain years.</p>\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold;\">LTSC:</div>\n<p>More like both of us, okay? Let’s just put it this way: both of us have been in the industry for a while, so I’m not just ageing you – I’m ageing both of us, but I think you have a lot of advice to give. I mean, you talked about being in different departments, just got CITP designation, so congratulations on that, and so I think you’ve got a well-rounded knowledge of international trade and supply chain. So, what is some advice that you would give to the next generation of supply chain professionals?</p>\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Audrey:</div>\n<p>Ooh. Definitely make connections and don’t think of it super strategically, like don’t think, oh, I need to meet all the people in supply chain. You need to meet all the people everywhere. I have spent a lot of time building relationships with people in just various areas – I’ve met people – my cousin is in HR and I went to her HR conference them up (change “them up” to “met up with”) a bunch of HR people, and they are really fun and fascinating. I do a nonprofit fashion group, so I meet a bunch of fashion – and like, I have my friends, I have my work, but I think having a variety of people because most industries are starting to kind of breakdown their silos and because a lot of success is happening through collaboration and not just oh, and collaborating with this very like-minded similar/same person, it’s like, no, collaborations, you see all these fun collaborations happening which you are like, oh, I didn’t think I could pair this product with this product. It’s like, we are not very coffee with cream anymore. We are very coffee with pomegranates. The concept of the complementary collab is just completely turned on its head, so forgetting experience and knowledge for learning, having a variety of connections really has, I think helped me to stand out and helped me to have some really interesting and unique opportunities.</p>\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold;\">LTSC:</div>\n<p>Yeah, and it’s how you learn too, right? And you never know where your next opportunity is.</p>\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Audrey:</div>\n<p>Oh my gosh, you never know. You have no idea. Five years from now, the person I met at something like fashion, like that could be my new job, that could be my new customer, that could be my new best friend, you just have no idea, and it also means that the more variety of people that you know, I mean, the more unique and innovative your ideas will be because I myself have come from this kind of cultural background, I went to that kind of high school or this kind of university, or I worked in this kind of – but when you’re talking and interacting with other people, you’re like, “Oh, wait, that product works this way, but then it also works that way,” because I’ve had conversation and sharing with people with varieties of backgrounds and experiences, and I think that’s the new marketplace too, especially when you want to go global, you can’t think of like, oh, well, in Canada, we do these Canadian things, and that I’m going to sell this product to Mexico or to South Africa, like it might not work there. So, it’s building kind of contacts and ability and experience that has different stories and has a diversity and yeah, creativity to it. That’s kind of where the market is going, right? And especially global, just can’t come at it from one perspective, you’ve got to think of different demographics, different lived experience, different lifestyle – everything.</p>\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold;\">LTSC:</div>\n<p>Absolutely. So, in saying that in giving that advice which I think is really amazing advice and not necessarily something that everybody talks about, but what would be the one single thing that you would urge them to get started on today in their journey to success?</p>\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Audrey:</div>\n<p>Yeah. Ooh, one thing. If they haven’t done –</p>\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold;\">LTSC:</div>\n<p>Well, just to get started with, just like an actionable step for them to do – put in action today that’s going to make a difference in their journey</p>\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Audrey:</div>\n<p>Definitely have a solid social media or a social presence. I mean, I like LinkedIn for business and it’s really gone global, but yeah, finding a network, like a LinkedIn and it really being fairly consistent. It doesn’t have to take up – it’s not like hours and hours of time every day but just being really – creating a good profile, and then kind of interacting with people, it’s a really good way to meet new people from the comfort of your like, your cell phone. Really, you can do it on your phone, so that is an easy one.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold;\">LTSC:</div>\n<p>Well – and the one thing that I want to point out that it’s not just about finding your voice – it’s about having a voice. When you are posting, make sure you are commenting on people’s posts and showing that you are a thought leader and that you have your own ideas, and that you want to bring – you want to be collaborative and you want to be able to help move this industry forward, and people will start noticing, but like everything else, it will take time as well. So, don’t get discouraged, keep going, but that is a really, really great point and something that is actionable that people can start doing right away. You don’t have to write articles, like all the time. Just engaging, talking to people, connecting with them, especially on LinkedIn and putting your comments is I think just as good as writing articles.</p>\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Audrey:</div>\n<p>I would agree with that.</p>\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold;\">LTSC:</div>\n<p>Last question: what’s next for Audrey?</p>\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Audrey:</div>\n<p>Ooh… Ooh, what is next? Coffee, probably, let’s do that. No, I think definitely, Orchard’s been working hard on expanding into Europe, so for me, that means kind of learning as much about some of our new customers and the different regions as possible, definitely we are hurtling toward Brexit, so staying on top of that is a challenge for me, and then I recently joined the board on the OWIT which is Organization for Women in International Trade, and so I had a great meeting with them in Washington last week – it was an amazing trip and just seeing how I can be supportive in the industry and certainly specifically to women in trade, women getting started. I like to as much as possible kind of give back to the community and answer questions and help people avoid some of the pitfalls or mistakes that I have made. If other people can avoid those, that would be great. what’s next for me.</p>\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold;\">LTSC:</div>\n<p>And, you forgot one important thing – Well, no, your blog is coming out the end of April, and so I don’t think the TV show will be up by then, so we can say we’ve got the TV show The Trade Squad coming out after this blog and I think your podcast might be coming out around the same time as well, so we are doing so many collaborative things together and I cannot wait to see where this goes. I think it’s going to be so much fun and people are going to love it. Are you excited?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Audrey:</div>\n<p>Yes. I’m so excited! What kind of trouble can we get into?</p>\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold;\">LTSC:</div>\n<p>Well, thank you, Audrey for coming on the blog and being part of my Woman in Supply Chain series.</p>\n<div style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Audrey:</div>\n<p>So excited. Thank you so much.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>By Sheri Spinks</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>ENGAGED CULTURE</p>\n<p>It is often said that two heads are better than one, but if those heads belong to two individuals that share the exact same values, beliefs, background, skills and experience, culture, and education – where is the value in that?</p>\n<p>If you were a coach, would you build a hockey team of all goalies and expect to win?   The same strategy applies for building a successful workforce, supply chain and organization.  In business, leaders and teams that recognize the importance of an inclusive culture that leverages a diverse mix of individual talent, experience, thought and skills develop a competitive advantage in which they can fully engage the talents of their people and partners, meet the needs of global clients, and build meaningful relationships in the communities in which they live, work and serve.</p>\n<p>STRATEGY</p>\n<p>A diverse strategy delivers strength and success in the form of innovation, brand enhancement and revenue generation when an organization effectively combines their shared values, mission and purpose with the recognition, celebration and inclusion of differences demonstrated by their customers, people, partners and suppliers.</p>\n<p>ARE YOU A LEADER?</p>\n<p>“Strength lies in differences, not in similarities”– Stephen R. Covey</p>\n<p>SUPPLIER DIVERSITY</p>\n<p>Supplier diversity is the extension of diversity and inclusion to the supply chain, whereby organizations actively seek out, partner and do business with certified minority ‘diverse’ suppliers that support and fulfil corporate business needs.  Minority-owned suppliers are often more flexible and agile and demonstrate an ability to cater to the needs of their customers on a level that is seldom seen with large corporate suppliers.</p>\n<p>ELEMENTS OF SUCCESS</p>\n<p>The success of a robust supplier diversity program relies heavily on the effective integration and alignment of program goals to the corporate strategy, goals and objectives.  Any program should start with these critical elements and then be tweaked to suit their own organizational needs:</p>\n<p>Support the corporate strategy, vision and goals</p>\n<p>Create an equal opportunity for all suppliers to participate in the supply chain</p>\n<p>Publish a clearly defined supplier diversity policy that outlines executive management commitment and overall management accountability</p>\n<p>Strengthen and improve supply chain performance via new innovative partners offering cost-effective, valuable solutions that solve business challenges</p>\n<p>Brand enhancement and equity improvements</p>\n<p>Supplier diversity success measures and metrics– efforts and utilization</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>BUSINESS VALUE</p>\n<p>The business case for diversity extends way beyond traditional benefits of corporate social responsibility and is not about doing the right thing, but the smart thing.  Diversity drives both business and economic value.  By employing diverse talent and doing business with diverse suppliers, organizations are having a direct positive impact on the economic state of communities and sustainability of suppliers, increasing collective buying power and market demand presenting both top and bottom line organizational growth opportunities.</p>\n<p>BUSINESS EXCELLENCE</p>\n<p>Diversity and inclusion programs and initiatives are no longer nice to have, but rather a standard of business excellence and an expectation on a consumer, employee, investor and partner level.</p>\n<p>An organization that successfully implements a holistic program that encompasses diversity and inclusion of people, partners, suppliers and communities are well equipped to rise to leaders within their respective markets, in their communities and on a global level.</p>\n<p>Want to learn more?</p>\n<p>You can get in touch with Sheri at her coordinates below to chat about all things supply chain &amp;

    "content": "<p>We no longer go through the three traditional stages of life :education, work and retirement it is therefore more likely we will experience some type of gap during our careers.Returners include: family caregivers,stay at home parents,students and retirees.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Why would someone choose supply chain over other career options after a gap in the workforce?</p>\n<p>There are so many excellent reasons to consider :Development of transferable skillsShortage of employeesAdvancement opportunitiesVariety of positionsCompetitive salariesGrowth of e-retailing is creating new opportunitiesTravelIndustry optionsInternship optionsRewardingNot likely to get bored on the jobTake upgrading courses while being employed Before I had left the workforce I had completed my principles courses for the PMAC designation but had not continued while I was at home.After having the privilege of staying home with our three boys for 12 years we made a family decision that I would return to work. I gave myself a year to get back into the workforce and then started my journey.I asked myself how am I going to approach this and how and where do I start?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I took the problem solving steps for case studies and combined that with a gap Analysis and started my journey.When I attended the first Supply Chain event &#8211; Sustainability event upon deciding to return to work I told myself you are just like them. The only difference is your pass doesn’t have a company name listed under your name.</p>\n<p>I looked at this event as an opportunity to present myself as a peer to the other attendees. I prepared for this event by getting professional with my appearance:got a hair cut,bought a new suit,created a network card,got my free pass and gave myself a pep talk that I could introduce myself to as many attendees as possible.</p>\n<p>I hopped on the Go train and spent the next 45 minutes convincing myself I could do this after being home for 12 years. I arrived at the event and stood back and gave myself a once over to make sure I was good&#8230;I told myself you are just like them only you don’t have a company on your hello tag&#8230;.now let’s go find an opportunity.</p>\n<p>It was nerve racking to walk into the large room full of a couple hundred professionals and vendors with their booths. I challenged myself to meet as many people as I could and hand out my network card. I had brought a couple hundred cards with me in my portfolio.</p>\n<p>I started talking to as many as I could and one of the ladies I spoke with was very interested in my journey. She was the editor of PurchasingB2B magazine which is now Supply Pro and is distributed across Canada. We talked for awhile and then she asked me if I would like to write an article. I accepted and was thrilled to have such an opportunity.</p>\n<p>I was so excited it was a challenge to sit through the rest of the event and sit through the train ride home. I did not get any job offers from the event but did hear of a few upcoming opportunities.</p>\n<p>In doing my gap analysis combined with the problem solving format I identified companies in the area which were doing well,looked at which positions they were hiring for and the common three skills listed. I compare this to my skill set and the three that were common and then developed my plan.</p>\n<p>I needed to upgrade my skills in the most cost effective and time efficient manners possible as we had three little boys still at home.</p>\n<p>I asked for manuals for PowerPoint and Visio as gifts and taught myself these over the summer, I did online typing tutorials, I took some free one day beginner word and excel courses at an adult learning centre just to refresh myself. While at the adult learning centre I inquired about the advance level courses as most postings required intermediate to advance level office suite programs. I had previously taken these in college many years before. I looked at the manuals and thought I could save a lot of time and money by just jumping into the advanced courses. They were one week long each which was great to quickly get these skills updated. I signed up and was very successful in completing both.</p>\n<p>I continued to search for opportunities by cold calling companies and networking. One of the local companies I contacted and left a voice mail with their Human Resources contact returned my call.</p>\n<p>The Human Resources lady stated they didn’t have anything currently but asked me to send my resume to her attention. I sent my resume to her and thought I won’t likely hear back. I was pleasantly surprised when she called back and said please come in for an interview.</p>\n<p>I reached out to my contacts and sent them my resume and asked for their support as references. I researched both the company and the two individuals which were interviewing me. I got in a positive mindset told myself I could do this and off I went with my network card,new suit,copies of my resume, copies of a communications presentation I had done for my last requirement to get my certificate in purchasing along with my Visio time I created plotting my one year plan to return to work.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The interview went very well, I had a lot of fun. I look at interviews as a research project where I find out as much as possible about the company and then want to find out if it’s a good fit. I am glad I did my research as during my interview they asked if I knew anything about the company and I said yes&#8230;they then said ok let’s turn this around and you ask us the questions about our company. We laughed and had a great time. I ended up getting the position. It was an entry level customer service position.</p>\n<p>They had a great three month training program which was very intensive and included an online university module with technical specifications. We were to complete two courses per month on the module and I took the opportunity to complete all 50 in the three months I was a CSR. They also offered the opportunity to job shadow fellow CSR S. While job shadowing I wanted to see what each individual CSR did that made their day easier: how they filled out reports, got through their emails, how they found technical specifications quickly, what did they do to just get through their day.</p>\n<p>I was approaching the end of my training and had put myself in the best position to move forward into the planning department which was really where I wanted to be within a year of getting back to work. I had visualized being in the planning department in the near future when one of the planners announced she was leaving the company.</p>\n<p>I was so excited the opportunity to move into planning was now available. I approached my boss and stated that I would like to apply and would she approve me to apply. She was not really happy that I wanted to move on but understood this was where I really wanted to be&#8230; I told her that I would be able to help her team more on the planning side and she approved my request.</p>\n<p>I contacted my references again and sent them my updated resume, got out my purchasing notes and reviewed them, got in the mindset of being on the planning side of the business and went to the interview. I was successful in getting into the planning department.</p>\n<p>Now I turned my focus on getting my CSCMP designation as I now was in a position financially and professionally to continue on with the workshops,In residence week and final exam.</p>\n<p>I gave myself one year to find a supply chain position closer to home as I was commuting, doing my designation online and our boys were still young and participating in after school activities it was challenging to keep up.</p>\n<p>One Sunday I came home from attending one of the workshops and thought that’s it I really need to be closer to home. I googled Supply Chain Analyst Whitby and thought nothing will be available and was surprised when a local position 15 minutes from our home was posted.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I sent off my resume and cover letter thinking again I likely would not hear back. I go to work on Monday and it was the Mondayest of Mondays&#8230;raining,dull and dreary. I’m tired and I just want to get home&#8230; I start driving home and my phone rings. I pull onto a side street as this was before I had Bluetooth in my car and answer the phone expecting it to be one of the kids&#8230; It was the VP of the local company I had just sent my resume to the night before.</p>\n<p>We talked for a few minutes and he said I think you are a good fit for this position, I agreed and then he mentioned the salary range. We were a little ways apart on this &#8230; I stated this seems like a good fit for both of us could we meet and discuss other forms of compensation which may bring us closer to an agreement. He said sure and we met for an interview.</p>\n<p>I prepared the same way as I had previously and brought along my published article as well. We had a great interview and agreed to communicate further by email as he was very busy and I was in an open office environment. We went back and forth a bit on the salary but agreed on the additional forms of compensation during the interview.</p>\n<p>I started seven and a half years ago as a Supply Chain Analyst and progressed to a Planner and now to my current position as Supply Chain Manager with my CSCMP designation.</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;\">About the Author:</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Who I am</p>\n<p>My goal is simple &#8211; to help others get back to work after a gap with a focus on negotiating.</p>\n<p>My passion for negotiating has positioned me to present and motivate people on the topic of getting back to work with a focus on negotiating beyond salary.</p>\n<p>✅ Speaker at One Woman Fearless Summit &#8211; May 2018</p>\n<p>✅ Speaker at Take the Lead Women In Supply Chain™ &#8211; Feb 2019</p>\n<p>✅Speaker at A Celebration of Women, IWD 2019 &#8211; March 2019</p>\n<p>✅Speaker at DevTO &#8211; April 2019</p>\n<p>✅Speaker at iRelaunch Return to Work Conference &#8211; June 2019</p>\n<p>✅Speaker at One Women Fearless Summit &#8211; July 2019</p>\n<p>✅ Featured articles in PurchasingB2B,Supply Professional &#8211; supplypro.ca</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"aNo8bymsZX\"><p><a href=\"https://www.supplypro.ca/opinions/showing-value-at-scmas-take-the-lead-women-in-supply-chain-event/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Showing value at SCMA&#8217;s Take the Lead: Women In Supply Chain™ event</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Showing value at SCMA&#8217;s Take the Lead: Women In Supply Chain™ event&#8221; &#8212; Supply Professional\" src=\"https://www.supplypro.ca/opinions/showing-value-at-scmas-take-the-lead-women-in-supply-chain-event/embed/#?secret=MdjvGJ6DGU#?secret=aNo8bymsZX\" data-secret=\"aNo8bymsZX\" width=\"500\" height=\"282\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>✅ Featured in an interview &#8220;Success Strategies for Getting Back to Work&#8221; &#8211; Girl Warrior Productions.com</p>\n<p>✅ Guest speaker on 3,2,1 iRelaunch Pod Cast &#8211; &#8220;Creating an Effective Return to Work Plan&#8221; with Lisa Fenton,CSCMP &#8211;</p>\n<p>https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/e72-creating-effective-return-to-work-plan-lisa-fenton/id1202049234?i=1000427893204&#038;mt=2</p>\n<p>✅ Certified Supply Chain Management Professional (CSCMP)</p>\n",
